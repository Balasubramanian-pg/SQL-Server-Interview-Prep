# 20. Default Port 1433 and Security

Canonical documentation for [20. Default Port 1433 and Security](5. Administration Security/20. Default Port 1433 and Security.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The purpose of this topic is to address the security implications, architectural considerations, and risk management strategies associated with the use of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) registered port 1433. As the industry-standard port for relational database communication—specifically the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol—port 1433 represents a critical entry point that requires rigorous defensive configurations to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the network and security principles rather than specific software configuration steps.

## Scope
This documentation covers the theoretical and practical security frameworks surrounding the use of well-known ports for database services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Network layer security principles for database listeners.
> * The "Security through Obscurity" debate regarding port reassignment.
> * Threat vectors targeting well-known ports.
> * Defense-in-depth strategies for database connectivity.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**

> * Troubleshooting specific connection string syntax for various programming languages.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Port 1433 | The standard TCP port assigned by IANA for database communication using the TDS protocol. |
| TDS | Tabular Data Stream; an application-level protocol used to transfer data between a client and a database server. |
| Port Scanning | A reconnaissance technique used by attackers to identify open ports and services on a network host. |
| Security through Obscurity | A security philosophy that relies on the secrecy of the implementation or configuration (e.g., changing a port) as a primary defense mechanism. |
| Defense in Depth | A strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout an information technology system. |

## Core Concepts
The fundamental concept of Port 1433 security revolves around the trade-off between **interoperability** and **vulnerability**. Because 1433 is the default, it ensures that clients and servers can communicate with minimal configuration. However, this predictability makes it a primary target for automated brute-force attacks and exploits.

> [!TIP]
> Think of Port 1433 as the "Main Entrance" of a high-security building. While it is the most convenient way for authorized visitors to enter, it is also the first place an intruder will check. Security is not achieved by moving the door to a hidden location, but by ensuring the door is reinforced and guarded.

### The Reconnaissance Phase
Attackers use automated tools to scan IP ranges for Port 1433. An open port 1433 confirms the presence of a database service, allowing the attacker to tailor their exploits to specific database vulnerabilities or initiate credential stuffing attacks.

## Standard Model
The standard model for securing Port 1433 follows the principle of **Least Privilege** and **Network Segmentation**.

1.  **Isolation:** The database server should reside in a private subnet, inaccessible directly from the public internet.
2.  **Access Control:** Firewalls (Network ACLs) should be configured to allow traffic on Port 1433 only from known, trusted IP addresses (e.g., application servers).
3.  **Encryption:** All traffic over Port 1433 must be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and packet sniffing.
4.  **Authentication:** Strong, multi-factor authentication or integrated identity management should be used to validate any connection reaching the port.

## Common Patterns
*   **Port Reassignment:** Moving the database listener from 1433 to a non-standard port (e.g., 54321) to reduce the noise of automated scans.
*   **Gateway/Proxy Usage:** Placing a database proxy or a jump box between the client and the database server to inspect and filter traffic.
*   **Dynamic Ports:** Utilizing dynamic port allocation where the service listens on an ephemeral port, and a discovery service (like a browser service on UDP 1434) directs the client.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Public Exposure:** Allowing `0.0.0.0/0` (all IPv4 addresses) access to Port 1433.
*   **Reliance on Obscurity:** Changing the port to a non-standard number and assuming no further security (firewalls, encryption) is necessary.
*   **Unencrypted Payloads:** Transmitting sensitive data over Port 1433 without TLS, assuming the internal network is "safe."

> [!CAUTION]
> Never assume that changing the default port from 1433 to a custom port constitutes a complete security solution. Modern port scanners can identify the service type regardless of the port number used.

## Edge Cases
*   **Legacy Systems:** Older applications may have hardcoded dependencies on Port 1433, making reassignment impossible without significant refactoring.
*   **Multi-Instance Hosting:** When multiple database instances reside on a single host, only one can occupy Port 1433, necessitating a strategy for port mapping or named instances.
*   **Containerized Environments:** In microservices architectures, Port 1433 might be mapped to a different external port on a load balancer, creating a discrepancy between the internal and external network views.

## Related Topics
*   **TDS Protocol Specifications:** The underlying communication format used on Port 1433.
*   **Firewall Management:** The primary mechanism for restricting access to database ports.
*   **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** The standard for encrypting data in transit.
*   **UDP Port 1434:** The SQL Browser service often used in conjunction with Port 1433 for instance discovery.
