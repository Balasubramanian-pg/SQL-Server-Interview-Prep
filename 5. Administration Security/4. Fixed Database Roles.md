# 4. Fixed Database Roles

Canonical documentation for [4. Fixed Database Roles](5. Administration Security/4. Fixed Database Roles.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Fixed database roles exist to provide a standardized, pre-configured security framework within a database environment. They address the complexity of granular permission management by grouping common administrative and operational tasks into immutable containers. By using fixed roles, organizations can implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) efficiently, ensuring that users have the necessary permissions to perform their functions without the administrative overhead of defining individual privileges for every user.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the architectural necessity of pre-defined security structures.

## Scope
This documentation covers the theoretical framework, categorization, and management principles of roles that are built into a database system by default.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Core functionality of pre-defined permission sets.
> * Theoretical boundaries between administrative and data-level roles.
> * The relationship between principals and fixed roles.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., T-SQL `db_datareader` vs. PostgreSQL `pg_read_all_data`).
> * Custom user-defined roles.
> * Operating system-level security groups.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Principal | An entity (user, group, or process) that can be granted access to database resources. |
| Privilege | A specific right to perform an action on a database object (e.g., SELECT, UPDATE, EXECUTE). |
| Fixed Role | A built-in security collective with a hardcoded set of privileges that cannot be altered by the user. |
| Immutability | The characteristic of fixed roles where the underlying permission set is constant and protected from modification. |
| Membership | The association of a principal with a role, granting the principal all privileges assigned to that role. |

## Core Concepts
The fundamental idea behind fixed database roles is the abstraction of security. Instead of managing thousands of individual permissions across hundreds of tables, the system provides "templates" of authority.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Fixed roles are the primary vehicle for RBAC within a database. They allow for the separation of duties by defining what a user *is* (e.g., a Backup Operator) rather than what they can *do* to specific rows of data.

**Immutability and Predictability**
Unlike custom roles, fixed roles provide a predictable security posture. An auditor or administrator knows exactly what a "Data Reader" role can access regardless of when or where the database was deployed.

> [!TIP]
> Think of fixed roles like pre-set stations on a radio. While you can choose which station to listen to (assigning a user to a role), you cannot change the frequency or the broadcast content of that specific station (the permissions within the role).

## Standard Model
The standard model for fixed database roles typically categorizes roles into three functional tiers:

1.  **Administrative Roles:** Roles that manage the database engine itself, including security, backups, and performance monitoring.
2.  **Owner Roles:** Roles with full control over a specific database instance or schema, including the ability to drop objects or change ownership.
3.  **Data-Level Roles:** Roles focused on the manipulation of data (DML) without the ability to alter the structure (DDL) or security of the database.

Commonly recognized fixed roles include:
*   **Database Owner:** Full control over the database.
*   **Security Administrator:** Ability to manage memberships and permissions.
*   **Access Administrator:** Ability to add or remove access for other principals.
*   **Data Reader:** Permission to read all data from all user tables and views.
*   **Data Writer:** Permission to add, delete, and change data in all user tables.
*   **DDL Administrator:** Permission to run Data Definition Language commands (Create, Alter, Drop).

## Common Patterns
**The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**
The most common pattern is assigning the most restrictive fixed role that allows a user to complete their task. For example, a reporting service account should be assigned to a "Data Reader" role rather than an "Owner" role.

**Service Account Segregation**
Applications are often mapped to specific fixed roles based on their function. A migration tool might require "DDL Administrator" status, while a standard web application only requires "Data Reader" and "Data Writer."

**Role Nesting**
In some models, fixed roles can be members of other roles, creating a hierarchy of permissions where higher-level roles inherit the privileges of lower-level ones.

## Anti-Patterns
**Over-Provisioning (The "Owner" Fallacy)**
Assigning the "Database Owner" role to standard users or applications to "avoid permission issues" is a critical security failure. This bypasses the entire purpose of fixed roles and creates a massive attack surface.

**Direct Permission Assignment**
Granting individual table permissions to a user who fits perfectly into a fixed role (like "Data Reader") creates "permission drift" and makes auditing significantly more difficult.

**Attempting to Modify Fixed Roles**
Trying to alter the permissions of a fixed role (where the system allows it through metadata manipulation) leads to unpredictable system behavior and can break system-level stored procedures or maintenance tasks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid using fixed administrative roles for automated application connections. If an application is compromised, an administrative role provides the attacker with the tools to delete the entire database or escalate privileges.

## Edge Cases
**Orphaned Memberships**
When a principal is deleted at the system level but remains a member of a fixed database role, it can create "orphaned" entries. While these entries generally do not pose an immediate security risk, they can complicate migrations and security audits.

**Cross-Database Ownership Chaining**
In some environments, being a member of a fixed role in one database may grant implicit permissions in another database if "ownership chaining" is enabled. This can lead to unintended privilege escalation.

**System-Level vs. Database-Level Fixed Roles**
There is often a distinction between roles that manage the entire server/instance and roles that manage a single database. Confusion between these levels can lead to users having too much power over the entire environment when they only required access to one schema.
