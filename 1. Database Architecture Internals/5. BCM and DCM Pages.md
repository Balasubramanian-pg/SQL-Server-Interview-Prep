# 5. BCM and DCM Pages

Canonical documentation for [5. BCM and DCM Pages](1. Database Architecture Internals/5. BCM and DCM Pages.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The Business Capability Model (BCM) and Digital/Data Capability Model (DCM) pages exist to provide a structured, high-level abstraction of an organization’s functional and technical landscape. These pages serve as the "blueprints" for enterprise architecture, allowing stakeholders to visualize *what* an organization does (BCM) and *how* it is digitally enabled (DCM) without becoming entangled in the complexities of specific processes or organizational charts.

The primary problem space addressed is the misalignment between business strategy and technical execution. By standardizing these views, organizations can perform gap analyses, investment prioritization, and risk assessments with a common vocabulary.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the structural logic of capability modeling rather than specific software tooling.

## Scope
The scope of this document covers the theoretical framework, structural requirements, and relational logic of BCM and DCM pages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Hierarchical structuring of business and digital capabilities.
> * Definitions of capability maturity and health.
> * The relationship between business needs and technical enablers.
> * Standardized visualization patterns (e.g., heatmapping).

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., ServiceNow APM, LeanIX, Ardoq).
> * Detailed business process modeling (BPMN).
> * Individual project management or task-level tracking.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Business Capability (BC) | A stable, high-level description of what a business does to reach its objectives, independent of how it is performed. |
| Digital Capability (DC) | The specific technical or data-driven competencies required to support one or more business capabilities. |
| BCM Page | A visual and data-driven representation of the Business Capability Model hierarchy. |
| DCM Page | A visual and data-driven representation of the Digital or Data Capability Model hierarchy. |
| Capability Heatmap | A visualization technique used on BCM/DCM pages to indicate performance, cost, or risk using color-coded overlays. |
| Level 1 (L1) Capability | The highest level of abstraction, representing broad functional areas (e.g., Human Resources, Supply Chain). |

## Core Concepts
The fundamental idea behind BCM and DCM pages is the decoupling of "What" from "How." 

**1. Stability Over Time**
Business capabilities are inherently stable. While a process (how you do it) might change due to a new software implementation, the capability (e.g., "Payroll Processing") remains constant.

**2. Hierarchical Decomposition**
Capabilities are organized into tiers. L1 represents the executive view, while L2 and L3 provide the granular detail necessary for operational planning.

**3. The "Mirror" Relationship**
The BCM and DCM pages act as mirrors. The BCM identifies the demand (what the business needs), and the DCM identifies the supply (the digital assets and data structures available to meet that need).

> [!TIP]
> Think of the BCM as the "Menu" in a restaurant (what is offered) and the DCM as the "Kitchen Equipment and Ingredients" (what is needed to produce the menu items). The customer doesn't need to see the kitchen, but the kitchen must be perfectly aligned with the menu to succeed.

## Standard Model
The standard model for BCM and DCM pages follows a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) framework.

*   **Structure:** A nested grid or tree structure where each parent capability is the sum of its children.
*   **Attributes:** Each capability on these pages should ideally track:
    *   **Strategic Importance:** How critical is this to the business?
    *   **Maturity:** How well is this capability currently performed?
    *   **Technology Fit:** How well do the current digital tools support this capability?
*   **Linkage:** Every DCM entry should map to at least one BCM entry to justify its existence within the enterprise.

## Common Patterns
*   **Strategic Heatmapping:** Using the BCM page to highlight areas of high strategic importance but low maturity to guide investment.
*   **Rationalization:** Using the DCM page to identify redundant digital capabilities (e.g., three different platforms performing the same "Customer Data Management" capability).
*   **Impact Analysis:** Using the relationship between BCM and DCM to determine which business areas will be affected by a technical outage or upgrade.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Organizational Mirroring:** Modeling capabilities based on the current org chart. Departments change; capabilities do not.
*   **Process Overload:** Including "How-to" steps within a capability model. If it has a sequence of events, it is a process, not a capability.
*   **Over-Granularity:** Creating L4 or L5 levels that become impossible to maintain. Most organizations find the "sweet spot" at L3.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where a Business Capability is defined by the Digital Capability that supports it. This creates tight coupling that prevents objective technology assessment.

## Edge Cases
*   **Emerging Capabilities:** How to represent capabilities that the business does not yet possess but intends to build (e.g., "AI-Driven Predictive Analytics"). These are often marked as "Target Capabilities."
*   **Shared Services:** Capabilities that serve multiple L1 areas (e.g., "Data Privacy Compliance"). These require careful placement to avoid duplication.
*   **Mergers and Acquisitions:** The challenge of reconciling two different BCM/DCM structures into a single unified page.

## Related Topics
*   **Application Portfolio Management (APM):** The specific software tools that realize the capabilities defined in the DCM.
*   **Information Architecture:** The data entities that flow between capabilities.
*   **Value Stream Mapping:** The end-to-end flow of value that utilizes multiple capabilities in a specific sequence.
