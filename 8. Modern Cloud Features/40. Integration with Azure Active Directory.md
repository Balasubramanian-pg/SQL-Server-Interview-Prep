# 40. Integration with Azure Active Directory

Canonical documentation for 40. Integration with Azure Active Directory. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 40. Integration with Azure Active Directory exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of integrating with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is to provide a centralized identity and access management solution for applications, enabling secure authentication, authorization, and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. This integration addresses the problems of managing multiple identities, passwords, and access controls across different applications and services, reducing the risk of identity-related security breaches and improving user experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Azure AD integration involves connecting applications, services, or systems to Azure AD, allowing users to access resources using their Azure AD credentials. This integration enables features such as SSO, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and conditional access, providing a secure and seamless experience for users.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Azure AD | Azure Active Directory, a cloud-based identity and access management service |
| SSO | Single Sign-On, a feature that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials |
| MFA | Multi-Factor Authentication, a security process that requires multiple forms of verification to access resources |
| OAuth | Open Authorization, a protocol for authorization and authentication |
| OpenID Connect | An identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, providing authentication and profile information |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Azure AD integration include:
* Identity and access management: managing user identities, passwords, and access controls
* Authentication: verifying user identities using credentials, such as passwords, smart cards, or biometric data
* Authorization: controlling access to resources based on user roles, permissions, and policies
* SSO and MFA: providing secure and seamless access to resources

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Azure AD integration involves:
1. Registering the application or service with Azure AD
2. Configuring authentication and authorization settings
3. Implementing SSO and MFA capabilities
4. Integrating with Azure AD using protocols such as OAuth and OpenID Connect

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Azure AD integration include:
* Using Azure AD as an identity provider for SSO and MFA
* Implementing conditional access policies to control access to resources
* Using Azure AD groups and roles to manage access and permissions
* Integrating Azure AD with other Microsoft services, such as Office 365 and Microsoft 365

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Azure AD integration include:
* Using weak or outdated authentication protocols
* Failing to implement MFA or conditional access policies
* Not regularly reviewing and updating access controls and permissions
* Using Azure AD as a sole source of truth for identity management, without integrating with other identity sources
