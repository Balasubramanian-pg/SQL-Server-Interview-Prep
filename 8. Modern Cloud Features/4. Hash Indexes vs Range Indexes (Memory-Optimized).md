# 4. Hash Indexes vs Range Indexes (Memory-Optimized)

Canonical documentation for 4. Hash Indexes vs Range Indexes (Memory-Optimized). This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 4. Hash Indexes vs Range Indexes (Memory-Optimized) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Hash indexes and range indexes are two types of indexing techniques used in databases to improve query performance. The purpose of these indexes is to reduce the time it takes to retrieve data by providing a quick way to locate specific data. The problem space that hash indexes and range indexes address is the need for efficient data retrieval in databases, particularly in memory-optimized tables where data is stored in memory for faster access.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Hash indexes and range indexes are data structures that enable fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of data in a database. Hash indexes use a hash function to map keys to specific locations in an array, while range indexes use a tree-like structure to store keys in a sorted order. This allows for efficient retrieval of data based on equality predicates (hash indexes) or range predicates (range indexes).

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Hash Index | A type of index that uses a hash function to map keys to specific locations in an array. |
| Range Index | A type of index that uses a tree-like structure to store keys in a sorted order. |
| Memory-Optimized Table | A type of database table that stores data in memory for faster access. |
| Index Key | A column or set of columns used to create an index. |
| Predicate | A condition used to filter data in a query. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of hash indexes and range indexes include:
* Hash functions: a hash function is used to map keys to specific locations in an array.
* Index keys: one or more columns are used to create an index.
* Predicates: conditions used to filter data in a query.
* Memory-optimized tables: data is stored in memory for faster access.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for hash indexes and range indexes involves creating an index on one or more columns of a table. The index is then used to speed up queries that filter data based on the indexed columns. For hash indexes, the hash function is used to map keys to specific locations in an array, while for range indexes, the tree-like structure is used to store keys in a sorted order.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using hash indexes and range indexes include:
* Creating a hash index on a column used in equality predicates.
* Creating a range index on a column used in range predicates.
* Using a combination of hash and range indexes to speed up queries that filter data based on multiple conditions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using hash indexes and range indexes include:
* Creating an index on a column with low cardinality (i.e., a column with few unique values).
* Creating an index on a column that is not used in any queries.
* Using a hash index for range predicates or a range index for equality predicates.
