## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 36. Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops exists to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of query processing systems by leveraging feedback mechanisms. The primary problem space addressed by this technology is the optimization of query execution plans, which can significantly impact system performance. Traditional query processing systems often rely on static optimization techniques, which can lead to suboptimal performance due to changing workload characteristics, data distributions, and system conditions. Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops aims to overcome these limitations by incorporating feedback loops that enable the system to adapt and improve its query processing strategies over time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops revolves around a closed-loop system, where the query processing engine continuously monitors its performance, gathers feedback, and adjusts its strategies to optimize query execution. This feedback loop involves several key components, including query execution, monitoring, analysis, and optimization. The system uses various techniques, such as machine learning, statistical modeling, and heuristic search, to analyze the feedback and generate improved query execution plans.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Feedback Loop | A closed-loop system where the output of a process is used as input to improve the process itself. |
| Query Execution Plan | A sequence of operations used to execute a query, including join orders, indexing, and aggregation strategies. |
| Optimization Strategy | A set of techniques used to improve the query execution plan, such as reordering joins, selecting indexes, or applying aggregation algorithms. |
| Machine Learning | A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training models on data to make predictions or optimize outcomes. |
| Query Processing Engine | A software component responsible for executing queries and managing the feedback loop. |

* **Closed-Loop Control**: The system incorporates a closed-loop control mechanism, where the output of the query execution process is used as input to improve the query execution plan.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops involves the following components:
1. **Query Reception**: The query processing engine receives a query and generates an initial query execution plan.
2. **Query Execution**: The query processing engine executes the query using the initial plan.
3. **Monitoring**: The system monitors the query execution and gathers feedback data.
4. **Analysis**: The system analyzes the feedback data to identify areas for improvement.

6. **Plan Update**: The system updates the query execution plan with the improved plan.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops include:
* **Reactive Optimization**: The system optimizes the query execution plan in response to changes in workload, data distribution, or system conditions.
* **Proactive Optimization**: The system anticipates and optimizes the query execution plan before changes occur.
* **Hybrid Optimization**: The system combines reactive and proactive optimization strategies to achieve a balance between responsiveness and anticipation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Intelligent Query Processing: Feedback Loops include:
* **Static Optimization**: The system uses static optimization techniques that do not adapt to changing conditions.
* **Over-Optimization**: The system over-optimizes the query execution plan, leading to increased complexity and decreased performance.
* **Lack of Monitoring**: The system fails to monitor query execution and gather feedback data, leading to suboptimal performance.
