# 24. MATCH Clause in Graph Queries

Canonical documentation for 24. MATCH Clause in Graph Queries. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The MATCH clause in graph queries exists to address the need for flexible and efficient pattern matching in graph databases. It allows users to specify patterns in the graph data, enabling the retrieval of specific subsets of data that match these patterns. The class of problems it addresses includes data retrieval, data integration, and data analysis in graph-structured data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The MATCH clause is a fundamental component of graph query languages, such as Cypher (used in Neo4j) or Gremlin (used in Apache TinkerPop). It provides a way to describe patterns in the graph, including nodes, relationships, and properties. These patterns can be used to filter, aggregate, and transform data in the graph, enabling a wide range of use cases, from simple data retrieval to complex data analytics.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Node | A fundamental entity in a graph, representing an object or concept. |
| Relationship | A connection between two nodes, representing a relationship or association between them. |
| Pattern | A description of a subset of the graph, including nodes, relationships, and properties. |
| MATCH Clause | A clause in a graph query that specifies a pattern to match in the graph. |
| Graph Query | A request to retrieve or manipulate data in a graph database. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The core concepts of the MATCH clause include:
* **Node matching**: specifying the nodes to include in the result set.
* **Relationship matching**: specifying the relationships to include in the result set.
* **Pattern matching**: combining node and relationship matching to describe complex patterns.
* **Filtering**: applying conditions to the matched data to filter out unwanted results.
* **Aggregation**: combining matched data to produce summary results.

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the MATCH clause involves specifying a pattern using a combination of node, relationship, and property descriptions. This pattern is then used to match data in the graph, and the resulting data is returned as a result set. The standard model includes support for:
* **Node labels**: specifying the types of nodes to match.
* **Relationship types**: specifying the types of relationships to match.
* **Property filters**: applying conditions to node and relationship properties.

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns using the MATCH clause include:
* **Simple node matching**: retrieving all nodes of a specific label.
* **Relationship traversal**: retrieving all nodes connected to a specific node via a specific relationship type.
* **Pattern matching**: retrieving all nodes and relationships that match a complex pattern.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common anti-patterns to avoid when using the MATCH clause include:
* **Overly broad patterns**: specifying patterns that match too much data, leading to performance issues.
* **Underly specific patterns**: specifying patterns that are too narrow, leading to missed results.
* **Inefficient filtering**: applying filters after matching, rather than as part of the matching process.
