# 38. Master Data Services (MDS) Basics

Canonical documentation for 38. Master Data Services (MDS) Basics. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 38. Master Data Services (MDS) Basics exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Master Data Services (MDS) is a framework that enables organizations to manage a single, unified version of their master data. The primary purpose of MDS is to provide a centralized repository for master data, ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and integrity across the enterprise. MDS addresses the problems of data silos, data inconsistencies, and data duplication, which can lead to incorrect business decisions, inefficient operations, and increased costs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of MDS involves a centralized master data repository that integrates data from various sources, applies business rules and validation, and provides a single, unified view of the data. This repository is accessed and managed through a user interface, allowing authorized users to create, update, and approve master data. The MDS framework also includes features such as data governance, data quality, and data security to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and confidentiality of the master data.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Master Data | A set of core data entities that are critical to an organization's operations, such as customer, product, and supplier data. |
| Master Data Management (MDM) | A comprehensive framework for managing master data across an enterprise, including data governance, data quality, and data integration. |
| Data Governance | The process of defining, implementing, and enforcing policies and procedures for managing master data, including data ownership, data quality, and data security. |
| Data Quality | The process of ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of master data, including data validation, data cleansing, and data normalization. |
| Data Steward | An individual responsible for managing and maintaining the quality and integrity of master data, including data governance, data quality, and data security. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of MDS include:
* Master data management: The process of creating, updating, and managing master data across an enterprise.
* Data governance: The process of defining, implementing, and enforcing policies and procedures for managing master data.
* Data quality: The process of ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of master data.
* Data security: The process of protecting master data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
* Data integration: The process of integrating master data from various sources into a single, unified view.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for MDS involves a centralized master data repository that integrates data from various sources, applies business rules and validation, and provides a single, unified view of the data. This repository is accessed and managed through a user interface, allowing authorized users to create, update, and approve master data. The standard model also includes features such as data governance, data quality, and data security to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and confidentiality of the master data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in MDS include:
* Data validation: The process of checking master data for accuracy and completeness.
* Data normalization: The process of transforming master data into a standardized format.
* Data cleansing: The process of removing duplicates, correcting errors, and filling in missing values in master data.
* Data integration: The process of integrating master data from various sources into a single, unified view.
* Data governance: The process of defining, implementing, and enforcing policies and procedures for managing master data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in MDS include:
* Data silos: The practice of storing master data in isolated, disconnected systems.
* Data duplication: The practice of duplicating master data across multiple systems.
* Lack of data governance: The failure to define, implement, and enforce policies and procedures for managing master data.
* Poor data quality: The failure to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of master data.
* Inadequate data security: The failure to protect master data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
