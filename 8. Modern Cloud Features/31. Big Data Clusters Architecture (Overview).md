> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 31. Big Data Clusters Architecture (Overview) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Big Data Clusters Architecture exists to provide a scalable, flexible, and efficient framework for processing and analyzing large volumes of data. The class of problems it addresses includes data ingestion, storage, processing, and analysis, as well as data security, governance, and compliance. The architecture is designed to support a wide range of use cases, from batch processing and real-time analytics to data science and machine learning.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Big Data Clusters Architecture is based on a distributed computing model, where data is processed in parallel across a cluster of nodes. The architecture consists of several layers, including data ingestion, storage, processing, and analysis, as well as management and governance layers. The architecture is designed to be scalable, flexible, and extensible, with a focus on supporting a wide range of data formats, processing frameworks, and analytics tools.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Big Data | Refers to large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data that require advanced processing and analysis techniques. |
| Cluster | A group of nodes that work together to process and analyze data in parallel. |
| Node | A single machine or server that participates in a cluster and contributes processing power and storage. |
| Distributed Computing | A model of computing where data is processed in parallel across a network of nodes. |
| Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased load and demand without compromising performance. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Big Data Clusters Architecture include:
* Distributed computing: processing data in parallel across a cluster of nodes
* Scalability: handling increased load and demand without compromising performance
* Flexibility: supporting a wide range of data formats, processing frameworks, and analytics tools

* Data governance: ensuring data quality, security, and compliance

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Big Data Clusters Architecture consists of the following layers:
* Data Ingestion Layer: responsible for collecting and processing data from various sources
* Data Storage Layer: responsible for storing and managing data in a scalable and efficient manner
* Data Processing Layer: responsible for processing and analyzing data using various frameworks and tools
* Data Analysis Layer: responsible for providing insights and recommendations based on processed data
* Management and Governance Layer: responsible for managing and governing the entire architecture

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Big Data Clusters Architecture include:
* Using a distributed file system such as HDFS or Ceph for data storage
* Using a processing framework such as MapReduce or Spark for data processing
* Using a data analytics tool such as Hive or Pig for data analysis
* Using a data governance framework such as Apache Atlas or Apache Ranger for data governance

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Big Data Clusters Architecture include:
* Using a single-node architecture for large-scale data processing
* Using a relational database management system for big data storage
* Using a proprietary data format for data storage
* Ignoring data governance and security best practices
