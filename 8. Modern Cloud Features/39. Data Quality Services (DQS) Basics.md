Canonical documentation for 39. Data Quality Services (DQS) Basics. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 39. Data Quality Services (DQS) Basics exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Data Quality Services (DQS) is a set of tools and processes designed to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data within an organization. The primary purpose of DQS is to address the problem of poor data quality, which can lead to incorrect insights, flawed decision-making, and decreased operational efficiency. DQS Basics provides a foundation for understanding the principles and best practices of data quality management.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of DQS Basics involves understanding the data quality lifecycle, which includes data profiling, data cleansing, data validation, and data monitoring. It also involves recognizing the importance of data governance, data stewardship, and data quality metrics in ensuring the overall quality of an organization's data assets.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable. |
| Data Profiling | The process of analyzing data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. |
| Data Cleansing | The process of detecting and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data. |
| Data Validation | The process of verifying data against a set of rules, constraints, and standards. |
| Data Governance | The overall management and oversight of an organization's data assets. |
| Data Stewardship | The responsibility of ensuring the quality, security, and integrity of an organization's data assets. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DQS Basics include:
* Data quality dimensions (accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and reliability)
* Data quality processes (data profiling, data cleansing, data validation, and data monitoring)
* Data governance and data stewardship
* Data quality metrics and benchmarking
* Data quality tools and technologies (data quality software, data integration tools, and data analytics platforms)

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DQS involves a iterative and continuous approach to data quality management, which includes:
1. Data profiling and analysis
2. Data cleansing and correction
3. Data validation and verification
4. Data monitoring and reporting
5. Data governance and stewardship

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in DQS include:
* Using data quality scores to measure data quality
* Implementing data validation rules to ensure data consistency
* Using data profiling to identify data quality issues
* Establishing data governance policies and procedures
* Using data quality metrics to track and measure data quality improvements

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in DQS include:
* Ignoring data quality issues or assuming they will resolve themselves
* Using manual or ad-hoc methods for data cleansing and correction
* Failing to establish data governance policies and procedures
* Not monitoring or tracking data quality metrics
* Using inadequate or outdated data quality tools and technologies
