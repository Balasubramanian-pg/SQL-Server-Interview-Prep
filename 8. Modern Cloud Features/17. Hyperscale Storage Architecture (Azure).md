Canonical documentation for 17. Hyperscale Storage Architecture (Azure). This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 17. Hyperscale Storage Architecture (Azure) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure is designed to address the growing need for highly scalable, performant, and available storage solutions. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud-based services, the demand for storage that can handle massive amounts of data, support high-performance workloads, and provide unparalleled reliability has become a critical requirement. The Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure exists to provide a robust, flexible, and scalable storage framework that can efficiently manage large volumes of data, support a wide range of workloads, and ensure high availability and durability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure is based on a distributed, object-based storage model that allows for seamless scalability, high performance, and exceptional reliability. This architecture is designed to support a wide range of workloads, from small-scale applications to large-scale, data-intensive workloads. The core components of this architecture include storage nodes, distributed file systems, and advanced data management capabilities. These components work together to provide a highly available, durable, and scalable storage solution that can efficiently manage large volumes of data.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Blob Storage | A type of object storage that allows for storing and serving large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and audio files. |
| Container | A logical grouping of blobs that can be used to organize and manage storage resources. |
| Distributed File System | A file system that allows for concurrent access to shared files across multiple nodes, providing high availability and scalability. |
| Hyperscale Storage | A storage architecture designed to support massive scalability, high performance, and exceptional reliability. |
| Object Storage | A type of storage that manages data as a collection of objects, each containing a file and its associated metadata. |
| Storage Node | A server or device that provides storage resources and is part of a larger distributed storage system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure is based on several core concepts, including:
* **Distributed architecture**: The storage system is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the addition of new storage nodes as needed to increase capacity and performance.
* **Object-based storage**: Data is stored as a collection of objects, each containing a file and its associated metadata, allowing for efficient management and retrieval of data.
* **High-performance storage**: The architecture is optimized for high-performance workloads, providing low latency and high throughput for applications that require fast data access.
* **Advanced data management**: The architecture includes advanced data management capabilities, such as data replication, erasure coding, and data tiering, to ensure high availability, durability, and scalability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure consists of the following components:
* **Storage nodes**: Multiple storage nodes are used to provide a distributed storage system, allowing for scalability and high availability.
* **Distributed file system**: A distributed file system is used to provide a unified namespace and allow for concurrent access to shared files across multiple nodes.
* **Object storage**: Object storage is used to manage data as a collection of objects, each containing a file and its associated metadata.
* **Data management**: Advanced data management capabilities, such as data replication, erasure coding, and data tiering, are used to ensure high availability, durability, and scalability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure include:
* **Data lake**: A centralized repository that stores raw, unprocessed data in its native format, allowing for flexible processing and analysis.
* **Data warehouse**: A structured repository that stores processed, aggregated data, allowing for fast querying and analysis.
* **Content delivery**: A pattern that uses Hyperscale Storage to store and serve large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and audio files.
* **Backup and archive**: A pattern that uses Hyperscale Storage to store and manage backup and archive data, providing long-term retention and recovery capabilities.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Hyperscale Storage Architecture in Azure include:
* **Over-provisioning**: Provisioning more storage resources than needed, resulting in wasted capacity and increased costs.
* **Under-provisioning**: Provisioning insufficient storage resources, resulting in performance issues and decreased availability.
* **Inconsistent data management**: Failing to implement consistent data management practices, resulting in data inconsistencies and decreased data quality.
* **Inadequate security**: Failing to implement adequate security measures, resulting in unauthorized access and data breaches.
