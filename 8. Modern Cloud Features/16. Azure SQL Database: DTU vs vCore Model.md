# 16. Azure SQL Database: DTU vs vCore Model

Canonical documentation for 16. Azure SQL Database: DTU vs vCore Model. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 16. Azure SQL Database: DTU vs vCore Model exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Azure SQL Database DTU (Database Transaction Unit) and vCore models exist to provide customers with flexible and scalable pricing options for their database needs. The class of problems these models address includes the need for predictable pricing, scalable performance, and optimized resource allocation for databases in the cloud. The DTU model provides a blended measure of CPU, memory, and I/O resources, while the vCore model offers a more granular approach to resource allocation, allowing customers to scale individual components independently.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Azure SQL Database DTU and vCore models represent two distinct approaches to provisioning and pricing database resources in the cloud. The DTU model is a legacy approach that bundles CPU, memory, and I/O resources into a single unit of measurement, while the vCore model is a more modern approach that allows customers to scale individual resources independently. Understanding the differences between these models is crucial for optimizing database performance, reducing costs, and ensuring scalability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DTU | A Database Transaction Unit, which is a blended measure of CPU, memory, and I/O resources. |
| vCore | A virtual core, which represents a single CPU core and is used as a unit of measurement for provisioning and pricing database resources. |
| CPU | Central Processing Unit, which executes instructions and performs calculations. |
| Memory | Random Access Memory (RAM), which stores data temporarily while it is being processed. |
| I/O | Input/Output operations, which involve reading and writing data to and from storage. |
| Elastic Pool | A shared resource pool that allows multiple databases to share resources, providing a cost-effective solution for databases with variable workloads. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Azure SQL Database DTU and vCore models include:
* **Resource allocation**: The process of assigning resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O to databases.
* **Scalability**: The ability to increase or decrease resources as needed to match changing workload demands.
* **Pricing**: The cost of provisioning and using database resources, which varies depending on the chosen model and resource allocation.
* **Performance**: The ability of the database to execute transactions and queries efficiently, which is influenced by resource allocation and scalability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Azure SQL Database is the vCore model, which provides a more granular approach to resource allocation and pricing. This model allows customers to scale individual resources independently, providing greater flexibility and control over database performance and costs. The vCore model is recommended for most use cases, as it provides a more predictable and scalable approach to database resource allocation.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using the Azure SQL Database DTU and vCore models include:
* **Elastic pooling**: Using elastic pools to share resources among multiple databases, providing a cost-effective solution for databases with variable workloads.
* **Autoscaling**: Using autoscaling to automatically adjust resource allocation based on changing workload demands.
* **Right-sizing**: Regularly reviewing and adjusting resource allocation to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using the Azure SQL Database DTU and vCore models include:
* **Overprovisioning**: Allocating more resources than needed, resulting in wasted costs and inefficient resource utilization.
* **Underprovisioning**: Allocating insufficient resources, resulting in poor performance and potential downtime.
* **Not monitoring**: Failing to regularly monitor database performance and resource utilization, leading to missed opportunities for optimization and cost savings.
