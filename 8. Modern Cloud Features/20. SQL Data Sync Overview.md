# 20. SQL Data Sync Overview

Canonical documentation for 20. SQL Data Sync Overview. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. SQL Data Sync Overview exists and the class of problems it addresses.
SQL Data Sync is a service that enables users to synchronize data across multiple databases, both on-premises and in the cloud. The primary purpose of SQL Data Sync is to provide a unified view of data, ensuring that data is consistent and up-to-date across different databases, and to address the challenges of data fragmentation, inconsistency, and latency. The class of problems it addresses includes data integration, data replication, and data synchronization, which are critical in various scenarios such as disaster recovery, data warehousing, and real-time analytics.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
SQL Data Sync operates by creating a hub-and-spoke topology, where a central hub database acts as the master database, and multiple spoke databases are synchronized with the hub. The service supports bi-directional synchronization, allowing data to be synced between the hub and spokes, as well as between spokes. This enables real-time data integration and synchronization across multiple databases, ensuring that data is consistent and up-to-date.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Hub Database | The central database that acts as the master database in the SQL Data Sync topology. |
| Spoke Database | A database that is synchronized with the hub database. |
| Sync Group | A group of databases that are synchronized together. |
| Sync Direction | The direction of data synchronization, which can be bi-directional, hub-to-spoke, or spoke-to-hub. |
| Conflict Resolution | The process of resolving data conflicts that arise during synchronization. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of SQL Data Sync include data synchronization, conflict resolution, and data integrity. Data synchronization involves the process of syncing data between multiple databases, while conflict resolution involves resolving data conflicts that arise during synchronization. Data integrity ensures that data is consistent and accurate across all databases.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for SQL Data Sync involves creating a hub-and-spoke topology, where a central hub database acts as the master database, and multiple spoke databases are synchronized with the hub. This model supports bi-directional synchronization and provides a scalable and flexible architecture for data integration and synchronization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in SQL Data Sync include:
* Hub-and-spoke topology: A central hub database acts as the master database, and multiple spoke databases are synchronized with the hub.
* Bi-directional synchronization: Data is synced between the hub and spokes, as well as between spokes.
* Conflict resolution: Data conflicts are resolved using predefined rules or custom scripts.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in SQL Data Sync include:
* Using a single database as both the hub and spoke, which can lead to data inconsistencies and conflicts.
* Not implementing conflict resolution mechanisms, which can result in data loss or corruption.
* Not monitoring and troubleshooting synchronization issues, which can lead to data latency and inconsistencies.
