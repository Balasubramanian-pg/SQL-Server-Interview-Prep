# 14. Azure SQL Database: Single DB vs Elastic Pool

Canonical documentation for 14. Azure SQL Database: Single DB vs Elastic Pool. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 14. Azure SQL Database: Single DB vs Elastic Pool exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Azure SQL Database provides two primary service tiers for managing databases: Single Database and Elastic Pool. The Single Database tier is designed for a single, isolated database with its own set of resources, while the Elastic Pool tier allows for multiple databases to share a pool of resources. This documentation aims to clarify the differences between these two tiers and provide guidance on choosing the most suitable option for specific use cases.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Azure SQL Database's Single Database and Elastic Pool tiers can be thought of as two distinct approaches to managing database resources. The Single Database tier is ideal for applications with predictable and consistent workload patterns, where the database requires a dedicated set of resources. In contrast, the Elastic Pool tier is suited for applications with variable or unpredictable workload patterns, where multiple databases can share a pool of resources to optimize costs and improve efficiency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Single Database | A standalone database with its own set of dedicated resources, including CPU, memory, and storage. |
| Elastic Pool | A shared pool of resources that can be utilized by multiple databases, allowing for more efficient use of resources and cost optimization. |
| DTU (Database Transaction Unit) | A unit of measurement for the resources utilized by a database, including CPU, memory, and storage. |
| vCore | A virtual CPU core, used to measure the compute resources utilized by a database. |
| Database Size | The total amount of storage space allocated to a database. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Azure SQL Database's Single Database and Elastic Pool tiers include:
* Resource allocation: The process of assigning resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to a database or pool of databases.
* Scalability: The ability to increase or decrease the resources allocated to a database or pool of databases in response to changing workload patterns.
* Cost optimization: The process of minimizing costs by selecting the most suitable service tier and resource allocation for a specific use case.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Azure SQL Database involves choosing between the Single Database and Elastic Pool tiers based on the specific requirements of the application. The Single Database tier is recommended for applications with:
* Predictable and consistent workload patterns
* High resource requirements
* Low tolerance for resource contention
In contrast, the Elastic Pool tier is recommended for applications with:
* Variable or unpredictable workload patterns
* Multiple databases with shared resource requirements
* A need for cost optimization and efficient resource utilization

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Azure SQL Database include:
* Using the Single Database tier for critical, high-availability applications
* Using the Elastic Pool tier for development, testing, and production environments with multiple databases
* Implementing automated scaling and resource allocation to optimize costs and performance
* Monitoring database performance and adjusting resource allocation as needed

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Azure SQL Database include:
* Over-provisioning resources for a Single Database, resulting in unnecessary costs
* Under-provisioning resources for an Elastic Pool, leading to resource contention and performance issues
* Failing to monitor database performance and adjust resource allocation accordingly
* Using the wrong service tier for a specific use case, resulting in suboptimal performance and costs
