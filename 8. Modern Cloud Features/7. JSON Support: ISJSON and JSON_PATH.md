# 7. JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH

Canonical documentation for 7. JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 7. JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH functionality exists to address the growing need for efficient and effective handling of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data in various applications, particularly in relational databases. The primary problem space includes storing, querying, and manipulating JSON data, which has become increasingly prevalent in modern web and mobile applications. ISJSON and JSON_PATH are designed to simplify the process of working with JSON data, providing a standardized way to validate, extract, and transform JSON data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH functionality provides a high-level interface for working with JSON data, allowing users to easily validate, query, and manipulate JSON data. The ISJSON function checks if a given string is valid JSON, while the JSON_PATH function allows users to extract specific values or arrays from a JSON string using a path expression. This functionality enables developers to efficiently store, retrieve, and process JSON data, making it an essential tool for modern application development.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| ISJSON | A function that checks if a given string is valid JSON. |
| JSON_PATH | A function that extracts specific values or arrays from a JSON string using a path expression. |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format. |
| Path Expression | A string that specifies the location of a value or array within a JSON string. |
| JSON Value | A scalar value, such as a string, number, or boolean, within a JSON string. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH include:
* **JSON Validation**: The process of checking if a given string is valid JSON.
* **JSON Querying**: The process of extracting specific values or arrays from a JSON string using a path expression.
* **Path Expressions**: A way to specify the location of a value or array within a JSON string.
* **JSON Data Types**: The different data types that can be represented in JSON, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH involves using the ISJSON function to validate JSON data and the JSON_PATH function to extract specific values or arrays from a JSON string. This model is widely adopted in various relational databases and is recommended for efficient and effective handling of JSON data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH include:
* **Validating JSON Data**: Using the ISJSON function to check if a given string is valid JSON before storing or processing it.
* **Extracting JSON Values**: Using the JSON_PATH function to extract specific values or arrays from a JSON string.
* **Transforming JSON Data**: Using a combination of ISJSON and JSON_PATH functions to transform JSON data into a desired format.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using JSON Support: ISJSON and JSON_PATH include:
* **Not Validating JSON Data**: Failing to validate JSON data before storing or processing it, which can lead to errors and security vulnerabilities.
* **Using Incorrect Path Expressions**: Using incorrect or incomplete path expressions, which can result in incorrect or missing data.
* **Not Handling Errors**: Failing to handle errors that may occur during JSON validation or querying, which can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.
