# 30. Stretch Database (Deprecated Usage)

Canonical documentation for 30. Stretch Database (Deprecated Usage). This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 30. Stretch Database (Deprecated Usage) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Stretch Database feature was designed to address the issue of storing and managing large amounts of data in a database, particularly for cold data that is infrequently accessed. It allowed users to stretch their on-premises databases to the cloud, providing a cost-effective solution for data archiving and compliance. However, due to its deprecation, it is no longer recommended for new deployments, and existing users are advised to migrate to alternative solutions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Stretch Database feature was a hybrid solution that combined on-premises and cloud-based storage to provide a scalable and cost-effective data management solution. It enabled users to store frequently accessed data on-premises and move less frequently accessed data to the cloud, providing a seamless and transparent experience for applications and users.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Stretch Database | A deprecated feature that allowed users to stretch their on-premises databases to the cloud, providing a cost-effective solution for data archiving and compliance. |
| Cold Data | Infrequently accessed data that is stored in a database, often requiring large storage capacities and posing challenges for data management. |
| Hybrid Solution | A solution that combines on-premises and cloud-based storage to provide a scalable and cost-effective data management solution. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Stretch Database include:
* Data tiering: The process of separating data into different tiers based on access frequency and storing each tier in the most cost-effective location.
* Data migration: The process of moving data from on-premises storage to cloud-based storage, and vice versa.
* Transparent data access: The ability of applications and users to access data without knowing its physical location, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Stretch Database involves:
* Identifying cold data and separating it from frequently accessed data.
* Configuring the Stretch Database feature to migrate cold data to the cloud.
* Ensuring transparent data access for applications and users.
* Monitoring and optimizing data storage and access patterns.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Stretch Database include:
* Using Stretch Database for data archiving and compliance purposes.
* Implementing data tiering to optimize storage costs and performance.
* Integrating Stretch Database with other data management solutions, such as data warehousing and business intelligence.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Stretch Database include:
* Using Stretch Database for frequently accessed data, which can lead to performance issues and increased costs.
* Failing to monitor and optimize data storage and access patterns, resulting in suboptimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
* Not considering alternative solutions, such as cloud-native databases, which may offer better performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
