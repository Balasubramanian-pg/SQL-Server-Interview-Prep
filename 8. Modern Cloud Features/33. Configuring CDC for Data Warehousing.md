Canonical documentation for 33. Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 33. Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Configuring CDC (Change Data Capture) for Data Warehousing is a crucial process that enables the extraction of changed data from source systems and loads it into a data warehouse, providing a centralized repository for business intelligence and analytics. The primary purpose of CDC for Data Warehousing is to address the challenges of data integration, data freshness, and data consistency, which are essential for making informed business decisions. The class of problems it addresses includes data latency, data inconsistency, and the inability to track changes to data over time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing involves understanding the end-to-end process of capturing changes from source systems, transforming the data, and loading it into a data warehouse. This process typically involves the following components: source systems, CDC tools, transformation logic, and target data warehouse. The CDC tool captures changes from the source system, applies transformation logic to the changed data, and loads it into the data warehouse.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CDC | Change Data Capture, a process that captures changes made to data in a source system |
| Data Warehousing | A centralized repository that stores data from various sources in a single location, making it easier to access and analyze |
| ETL | Extract, Transform, Load, a process that extracts data from source systems, transforms it into a standardized format, and loads it into a target system |
| Source System | The system that contains the original data, such as a database or application |
| Target System | The system that receives the changed data, such as a data warehouse or data lake |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing include understanding the CDC process, data transformation, and data loading. The CDC process involves capturing changes from the source system, which can be done using various methods such as log-based CDC, trigger-based CDC, or query-based CDC. Data transformation involves converting the changed data into a standardized format that can be loaded into the data warehouse. Data loading involves loading the transformed data into the data warehouse, which can be done using various methods such as bulk loading or incremental loading.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing involves the following steps: 
1. Identify the source system and the data that needs to be captured
2. Choose a CDC tool that supports the source system and the target data warehouse
3. Configure the CDC tool to capture changes from the source system
4. Apply transformation logic to the changed data
5. Load the transformed data into the data warehouse
6. Monitor and manage the CDC process to ensure data freshness and consistency.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing include:
* Using log-based CDC for databases that support transaction logging
* Using trigger-based CDC for databases that do not support transaction logging
* Using query-based CDC for applications that do not support CDC
* Using ETL tools to transform and load data into the data warehouse
* Using data validation and data quality checks to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Configuring CDC for Data Warehousing include:
* Using a single CDC tool for multiple source systems without considering the specific requirements of each system
* Not monitoring and managing the CDC process, leading to data latency and inconsistency
* Not applying data transformation and data validation, leading to data quality issues
* Not considering the performance impact of CDC on the source system and the data warehouse
* Not documenting the CDC process and the data transformation logic, leading to maintenance and troubleshooting issues.
