# 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA

Canonical documentation for 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA is to provide a framework for understanding and managing the trade-offs between schema durability and data durability in database systems. The problem space addressed by this topic includes data loss, schema inconsistencies, and system failures, which can have significant consequences for data-driven applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA involves understanding the distinction between schema durability and data durability. Schema durability refers to the ability of a database system to maintain the integrity and consistency of its schema, which defines the structure and organization of the data. Data durability, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a database system to maintain the integrity and consistency of the data itself.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SCHEMA_ONLY | A durability mode that ensures the schema of a database is persisted and recoverable, but does not guarantee the durability of the data. |
| SCHEMA_AND_DATA | A durability mode that ensures both the schema and data of a database are persisted and recoverable. |
| Durability | The ability of a database system to maintain the integrity and consistency of its data and schema over time, despite failures or errors. |
| Schema | The definition of the structure and organization of data in a database, including tables, relationships, and constraints. |
| Data | The actual information stored in a database, including values, records, and files. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA include the trade-offs between schema durability and data durability, the importance of consistency and integrity in database systems, and the role of durability modes in ensuring the reliability and availability of data-driven applications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA involves using SCHEMA_AND_DATA as the default durability mode, which ensures that both the schema and data are persisted and recoverable. However, in certain scenarios, such as development or testing environments, SCHEMA_ONLY may be used to improve performance or reduce storage requirements.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA include using SCHEMA_AND_DATA for production environments, using SCHEMA_ONLY for development or testing environments, and using a combination of both durability modes for hybrid environments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 3. Durability: SCHEMA_ONLY vs SCHEMA_AND_DATA include using SCHEMA_ONLY for production environments, ignoring durability modes altogether, and using custom or ad-hoc durability mechanisms instead of standard durability modes.
