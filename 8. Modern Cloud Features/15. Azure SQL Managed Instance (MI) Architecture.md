# 15. Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture

Canonical documentation for 15. Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 15. Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture exists to provide a cloud-based, managed database service that offers a high level of compatibility with on-premises SQL Server, while also providing the benefits of a cloud-based platform, such as scalability, security, and reduced administrative burden. The class of problems it addresses includes the need for a managed database service that can support a wide range of database workloads, from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems, while also providing a high level of control and customization.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture is based on a cloud-based, virtualized infrastructure that provides a managed database service. The architecture consists of a set of virtual clusters, each of which contains one or more virtual instances. Each virtual instance is a self-contained database environment that provides a high level of isolation and security. The virtual instances are managed by a set of control planes, which provide services such as provisioning, patching, and monitoring.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Azure SQL Managed Instance | A cloud-based, managed database service that provides a high level of compatibility with on-premises SQL Server. |
| Virtual Cluster | A set of virtual instances that are managed together as a single unit. |
| Virtual Instance | A self-contained database environment that provides a high level of isolation and security. |
| Control Plane | A set of services that manage the virtual instances, including provisioning, patching, and monitoring. |
| Database | A collection of related data that is stored and managed by the Azure SQL Managed Instance. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture include:
* Virtualization: The use of virtual machines to provide a layer of abstraction between the physical infrastructure and the database environment.
* Containerization: The use of containers to provide a lightweight and portable way to deploy and manage databases.
* Microservices: The use of small, independent services to provide a scalable and flexible architecture.
* Automation: The use of automated scripts and tools to manage and maintain the database environment.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture consists of a set of virtual clusters, each of which contains one or more virtual instances. Each virtual instance is managed by a set of control planes, which provide services such as provisioning, patching, and monitoring. The virtual instances are connected to a set of storage accounts, which provide a scalable and durable way to store database files.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture include:
* Using a single virtual cluster to manage multiple virtual instances.
* Using a set of control planes to manage a large number of virtual instances.
* Using a combination of virtual instances and containers to provide a scalable and flexible architecture.
* Using automated scripts and tools to manage and maintain the database environment.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) Architecture include:
* Using a large number of virtual instances without a corresponding increase in control planes.
* Using a single virtual instance to manage a large number of databases.
* Using a combination of virtual instances and virtual machines without a clear understanding of the underlying architecture.
* Failing to automate routine maintenance tasks, such as backups and patching.
