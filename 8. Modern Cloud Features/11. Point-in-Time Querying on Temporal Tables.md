# 11. Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables

Canonical documentation for 11. Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 11. Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables exists to address the need for querying data at a specific point in time, taking into account the changes made to the data over time. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data is constantly being updated, and it is essential to track these changes. The class of problems it addresses includes data auditing, compliance, and historical data analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables involves storing data in a way that allows for efficient querying of data at any point in time. This is achieved by using temporal tables, which store a record of all changes made to the data, along with the timestamp of each change. This allows for querying the data as it existed at any point in the past.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Temporal Table | A table that stores a record of all changes made to the data, along with the timestamp of each change. |
| System-Time | The time at which a row was inserted, updated, or deleted. |
| Application-Time | The time at which a row is valid, as defined by the application. |
| Point-in-Time Query | A query that retrieves data as it existed at a specific point in time. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables include:
* Temporal tables: storing data with timestamps to track changes
* System-time and application-time: distinguishing between the time of data storage and the time of data validity
* Point-in-time queries: querying data as it existed at a specific point in time

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables involves using a combination of system-time and application-time to store and query data. This model includes:
* Creating temporal tables with system-time and application-time columns
* Inserting, updating, and deleting data with timestamps
* Querying data using point-in-time queries

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables include:
* Using temporal tables to store audit data
* Querying data for compliance and regulatory purposes
* Analyzing historical data to identify trends and patterns

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Point-in-Time Querying on Temporal Tables include:
* Not using temporal tables, resulting in data loss and inconsistencies
* Not distinguishing between system-time and application-time, leading to incorrect query results
* Not using point-in-time queries, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate data analysis
