# 32. Change Data Capture (CDC) vs Change Tracking

Canonical documentation for 32. Change Data Capture (CDC) vs Change Tracking. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 32. Change Data Capture (CDC) vs Change Tracking exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Tracking are two related but distinct concepts that address the need to identify, capture, and track changes made to data in a database or other data storage system. The primary purpose of CDC and Change Tracking is to provide a mechanism for detecting and responding to changes in data, which is essential for maintaining data consistency, integrity, and compliance. The class of problems that CDC and Change Tracking address includes data auditing, compliance, data integration, and business intelligence.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of CDC and Change Tracking involves understanding the data lifecycle, including data creation, modification, and deletion. CDC focuses on capturing the changes made to data in real-time, typically by reading the database transaction logs. Change Tracking, on the other hand, involves tracking changes to data over time, often using a separate data structure to store the change history. Both concepts rely on a deep understanding of the underlying data model, database architecture, and the requirements of the applications that use the data.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Change Data Capture (CDC) | The process of capturing changes made to data in a database or other data storage system in real-time. |
| Change Tracking | The process of tracking changes to data over time, often using a separate data structure to store the change history. |
| Data Auditing | The process of monitoring and recording changes to data to ensure compliance and data integrity. |
| Transaction Log | A record of all changes made to a database, including inserts, updates, and deletes. |
| Data Integration | The process of combining data from multiple sources to provide a unified view of the data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of CDC and Change Tracking include:
* **Data Change Detection**: The ability to detect changes made to data in real-time or over time.
* **Change Capture**: The process of capturing the changes made to data, including the type of change (insert, update, delete) and the data values affected.
* **Change Tracking**: The process of tracking changes to data over time, including the ability to store and manage the change history.
* **Data Consistency**: The ability to ensure that data remains consistent and accurate across multiple systems and applications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for CDC and Change Tracking involves the following components:
* **Data Source**: The database or other data storage system that contains the data to be captured or tracked.
* **CDC Agent**: A software component that captures changes made to the data in real-time.
* **Change Tracking Store**: A separate data structure that stores the change history.
* **Data Consumer**: An application or system that uses the captured or tracked data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for CDC and Change Tracking include:
* **Real-time Data Integration**: Using CDC to capture changes made to data in real-time and integrate the data with other systems or applications.
* **Data Auditing and Compliance**: Using Change Tracking to track changes to data over time and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
* **Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence**: Using CDC and Change Tracking to capture and track changes to data and provide a unified view of the data for business intelligence and analytics.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for CDC and Change Tracking include:
* **Polling**: Using periodic polling to detect changes made to data, rather than using CDC or Change Tracking.
* **Manual Data Synchronization**: Manually synchronizing data between systems or applications, rather than using automated CDC or Change Tracking.
* **Data Duplication**: Duplicating data across multiple systems or applications, rather than using CDC or Change Tracking to provide a unified view of the data.
