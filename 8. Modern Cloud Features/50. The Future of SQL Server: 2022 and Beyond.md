> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 50. The Future of SQL Server: 2022 and Beyond exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The future of SQL Server is a critical topic as it addresses the evolving needs of database administrators, developers, and organizations relying on the platform. The class of problems it addresses includes data management, scalability, security, and performance in the face of increasing data volumes, complexity, and regulatory requirements. As technology advances, SQL Server must adapt to support emerging trends such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The future of SQL Server encompasses a broad range of innovations and enhancements aimed at improving the platform's capabilities, flexibility, and user experience. This includes advancements in areas like database engine performance, data security, and integration with other Microsoft products and services. The conceptual model involves a continuous cycle of innovation, feedback, and refinement to ensure SQL Server remains a leading database management system.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SQL Server | A relational database management system developed by Microsoft. |
| Cloud Computing | A model for delivering computing services over the internet, on-demand and pay-per-use basis. |
| Artificial Intelligence (AI) | The development of computer systems able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. |
| Internet of Things (IoT) | A system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network. |
| Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) | A cloud computing service model that allows users to create, configure, and use database instances without the need for manually managing the underlying hardware. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts include the ongoing development of SQL Server to support modern data management needs, the integration of emerging technologies like AI and IoT, and the shift towards cloud-based services. Additionally, there is a focus on enhancing security, performance, and scalability to meet the demands of contemporary data-driven applications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the future of SQL Server involves a hybrid approach, combining on-premises deployments with cloud services to offer flexibility and scalability. This model also emphasizes the use of advanced security features, regular updates, and the adoption of best practices for database management and performance optimization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include the use of containerization for SQL Server deployments, the adoption of DevOps practices for database development and deployment, and the integration of SQL Server with other Microsoft tools and services such as Azure Synapse Analytics and Microsoft Power BI.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include neglecting regular security updates and patches, failing to implement appropriate backup and recovery strategies, and underestimating the importance of performance monitoring and optimization. Additionally, not planning for scalability and failing to adopt cloud services when beneficial are considered anti-patterns.
