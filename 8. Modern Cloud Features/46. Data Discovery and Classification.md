# 46. Data Discovery and Classification

Canonical documentation for 46. Data Discovery and Classification. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 46. Data Discovery and Classification exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Data Discovery and Classification exists to address the challenges of identifying, categorizing, and managing large volumes of data within an organization. The primary problem it solves is the lack of visibility and control over sensitive data, which can lead to data breaches, non-compliance with regulatory requirements, and inefficient data management. The class of problems it addresses includes data security, compliance, and governance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data Discovery and Classification involves a series of processes that enable organizations to discover, classify, and protect their data. The conceptual overview includes data discovery, data classification, data mapping, and data protection. It requires a deep understanding of the organization's data landscape, including data types, data sources, and data flows.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Discovery | The process of identifying and locating data within an organization, including data types, data sources, and data flows. |
| Data Classification | The process of categorizing data based on its sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements. |
| Data Mapping | The process of creating a visual representation of an organization's data landscape, including data types, data sources, and data flows. |
| Data Protection | The process of implementing controls and measures to protect data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. |
| Sensitive Data | Data that is subject to regulatory requirements, such as personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), or financial information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Data Discovery and Classification include:
* Data identification: identifying data types, data sources, and data flows within an organization.
* Data categorization: categorizing data based on its sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements.
* Data protection: implementing controls and measures to protect data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
* Data governance: establishing policies, procedures, and standards for managing data within an organization.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Data Discovery and Classification includes the following steps:
1. Data discovery: identifying and locating data within an organization.
2. Data classification: categorizing data based on its sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements.
3. Data mapping: creating a visual representation of an organization's data landscape.
4. Data protection: implementing controls and measures to protect data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
5. Data governance: establishing policies, procedures, and standards for managing data within an organization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Data Discovery and Classification include:
* Using data discovery tools to identify and locate data within an organization.
* Implementing data classification schemes to categorize data based on its sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements.
* Creating data maps to visualize an organization's data landscape.
* Implementing data protection controls, such as access controls, encryption, and backups.
* Establishing data governance policies, procedures, and standards to manage data within an organization.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Data Discovery and Classification include:
* Failing to implement data discovery and classification processes, leading to a lack of visibility and control over sensitive data.
* Using inadequate data classification schemes, leading to incorrect or inconsistent classification of data.
* Failing to implement data protection controls, leading to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of sensitive data.
* Ignoring data governance policies, procedures, and standards, leading to inconsistent management of data within an organization.
