Canonical documentation for 18. Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 18. Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling exists to address the need for efficient and cost-effective management of database resources in cloud-based environments. The primary problem it solves is the idle resource waste and scalability limitations associated with traditional database management systems. By automatically pausing and scaling database resources based on workload demands, Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling enables organizations to optimize resource utilization, reduce costs, and improve overall database performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling revolves around the idea of dynamic resource allocation and deallocation based on workload requirements. It involves a feedback loop that continuously monitors database activity, adjusts resource allocation accordingly, and automatically pauses or resumes database instances to minimize idle resource waste. This model is built on top of cloud-based infrastructure and leverages serverless computing principles to provide a scalable, on-demand database management system.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Auto-pause | The automatic suspension of database instances when they are idle or underutilized to minimize resource waste and reduce costs. |
| Scaling | The dynamic adjustment of database resources, such as compute power or storage, to match changing workload demands. |
| Serverless SQL | A cloud-based database management system that automatically manages database resources and scales to meet workload requirements without requiring manual intervention. |
| Workload | The amount of database activity, such as queries, transactions, or data processing, that needs to be handled by the database management system. |
| Idle Resource | A database resource, such as a compute instance or storage volume, that is not being utilized or is underutilized. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling include:
* **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: The ability to adjust database resources in real-time to match changing workload demands.
* **Auto-pause and Resume**: The automatic suspension and resumption of database instances to minimize idle resource waste and reduce costs.
* **Scaling**: The dynamic adjustment of database resources to match changing workload requirements.
* **Workload Monitoring**: The continuous monitoring of database activity to detect changes in workload demands and adjust resource allocation accordingly.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling involves the following components:
* **Cloud-based Infrastructure**: A cloud-based infrastructure that provides on-demand compute, storage, and networking resources.
* **Serverless SQL Engine**: A serverless SQL engine that manages database resources and scales to meet workload requirements.
* **Workload Monitoring**: A workload monitoring system that continuously monitors database activity and adjusts resource allocation accordingly.
* **Auto-pause and Resume**: An auto-pause and resume mechanism that automatically suspends and resumes database instances to minimize idle resource waste and reduce costs.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling include:
* **Event-driven Scaling**: Scaling database resources in response to specific events, such as changes in workload demands or database activity.
* **Scheduled Scaling**: Scaling database resources according to a predefined schedule, such as scaling up during peak hours and scaling down during off-peak hours.
* **Autonomous Scaling**: Allowing the serverless SQL engine to automatically scale database resources based on workload demands without requiring manual intervention.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Serverless SQL: Auto-pause and Scaling include:
* **Over-provisioning**: Provisioning more database resources than necessary, resulting in idle resource waste and increased costs.
* **Under-provisioning**: Provisioning insufficient database resources, resulting in performance degradation and decreased user experience.
* **Manual Scaling**: Manually scaling database resources, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
