# 23. Graph Database: Nodes and Edges

Canonical documentation for 23. Graph Database: Nodes and Edges. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 23. Graph Database: Nodes and Edges exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of a graph database is to efficiently store, manage, and query complex relationships between data entities. Graph databases address the problem of modeling and querying complex networks of interconnected data, which is a common challenge in various domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. The class of problems addressed by graph databases includes data integration, data querying, and data analysis in complex networks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A graph database consists of nodes (also known as vertices) and edges (also known as relationships) that connect these nodes. Nodes represent entities or objects, while edges represent the relationships between these entities. This mental model allows for the representation of complex networks of data, enabling efficient querying and analysis of the relationships between data entities.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Node | A node represents an entity or object in the graph, which can have properties or attributes associated with it. |
| Edge | An edge represents a relationship between two nodes, which can have properties or attributes associated with it. |
| Property | A property is a key-value pair associated with a node or edge, providing additional information about the entity or relationship. |
| Label | A label is a category or type assigned to a node or edge, allowing for grouping and filtering of data. |
| Relationship Type | A relationship type defines the nature of the connection between two nodes, such as "friend" or "follows". |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of graph databases include:
* **Node**: The fundamental entity in a graph database, representing an object or concept.
* **Edge**: The connection between two nodes, representing a relationship or interaction.
* **Graph**: The collection of nodes and edges, representing the complex network of data.
* **Traversal**: The process of navigating the graph, following edges to retrieve related data.
* **Querying**: The process of retrieving specific data from the graph, using queries that filter and aggregate data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for graph databases is based on the property graph model, which consists of:
* **Nodes**: Representing entities or objects, with properties and labels.
* **Edges**: Representing relationships between nodes, with properties and relationship types.
* **Graph**: The collection of nodes and edges, representing the complex network of data.
This model provides a flexible and expressive way to represent complex data, enabling efficient querying and analysis.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in graph databases include:
* **Star pattern**: A central node connected to multiple nodes, representing a hub-and-spoke relationship.
* **Chain pattern**: A sequence of nodes connected by edges, representing a linear relationship.
* **Tree pattern**: A hierarchical structure of nodes and edges, representing a nested relationship.
* **Cycle pattern**: A closed loop of nodes and edges, representing a circular relationship.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in graph databases include:
* **Over-normalization**: Splitting data into too many nodes and edges, leading to complex queries and poor performance.
* **Under-normalization**: Combining too much data into a single node or edge, leading to data redundancy and inconsistencies.
* **Tight coupling**: Creating edges between nodes that are not logically related, leading to data noise and query complexity.
