# 13. External Tables and Data Virtualization

Canonical documentation for 13. External Tables and Data Virtualization. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 13. External Tables and Data Virtualization exists and the class of problems it addresses.
External tables and data virtualization exist to address the challenges of integrating and managing data from diverse sources, formats, and locations. The primary problem space includes data silos, data duplication, and the complexity of managing multiple data sources. External tables and data virtualization provide a solution by enabling organizations to access, combine, and analyze data from various sources without physically moving or replicating the data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of external tables and data virtualization involves creating a virtual layer that abstracts the underlying data sources, providing a unified view of the data. This layer enables users to query, analyze, and manipulate the data as if it were stored in a single, centralized location. The virtual layer can be used to integrate data from various sources, including relational databases, cloud storage, files, and other data repositories.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| External Table | A virtual table that references data stored outside of the primary database or data repository. |
| Data Virtualization | The process of creating a virtual layer that abstracts the underlying data sources, providing a unified view of the data. |
| Virtual View | A virtual representation of the data that can be queried, analyzed, and manipulated as if it were a physical table. |
| Data Source | The original location of the data, which can be a relational database, cloud storage, file, or other data repository. |
| Data Federation | The process of integrating data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of external tables and data virtualization include:
* **Data Abstraction**: The process of creating a virtual layer that abstracts the underlying data sources.
* **Data Federation**: The process of integrating data from multiple sources into a single, unified view.
* **Virtualization**: The process of creating a virtual representation of the data that can be queried, analyzed, and manipulated as if it were a physical table.
* **Metadata Management**: The process of managing the metadata associated with the virtual layer, including data source information, data formats, and data relationships.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for external tables and data virtualization involves the following components:
* **Data Sources**: The original locations of the data, which can be relational databases, cloud storage, files, or other data repositories.
* **Virtual Layer**: The virtual layer that abstracts the underlying data sources, providing a unified view of the data.
* **Metadata Repository**: The repository that stores the metadata associated with the virtual layer, including data source information, data formats, and data relationships.
* **Query Engine**: The engine that executes queries against the virtual layer, retrieving data from the underlying data sources as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for external tables and data virtualization include:
* **Data Warehousing**: Using external tables and data virtualization to integrate data from multiple sources into a single, unified view for data analysis and reporting.
* **Data Integration**: Using external tables and data virtualization to integrate data from multiple sources into a single, unified view for data processing and transformation.
* **Real-Time Data Analytics**: Using external tables and data virtualization to provide real-time access to data from multiple sources for analytics and decision-making.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for external tables and data virtualization include:
* **Data Duplication**: Physically duplicating data from multiple sources, leading to data inconsistencies and increased storage requirements.
* **Tight Coupling**: Tightly coupling the virtual layer to a specific data source or technology, limiting flexibility and scalability.
* **Lack of Metadata Management**: Failing to manage metadata associated with the virtual layer, leading to data inconsistencies and integration challenges.
