# 22. Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link

Canonical documentation for 22. Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 22. Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link exists to provide a secure and private connection between Azure SQL Database and clients running in a virtual network. The primary problem it addresses is the need to protect data in transit and prevent unauthorized access to Azure SQL Database instances. By using Private Link, users can create a private endpoint for their Azure SQL Database, which allows them to access the database over a private IP address, reducing the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link feature enables users to create a private endpoint for their Azure SQL Database, which is essentially a network interface that connects the database to a virtual network. This private endpoint is assigned a private IP address from the virtual network's address space, allowing clients running in the virtual network to connect to the database over a private and secure connection. The private link connection is established using a combination of Azure networking and security features, including Azure Private Link, Azure Virtual Network, and network security groups.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Private Endpoint | A network interface that connects a Azure SQL Database to a virtual network, allowing clients to access the database over a private IP address. |
| Private Link | A secure and private connection between Azure SQL Database and clients running in a virtual network, established using Azure Private Link and Azure Virtual Network. |
| Virtual Network | A virtualized network environment that allows users to create and manage their own virtual networks in the cloud. |
| Network Security Group | A security feature that allows users to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from a virtual network. |
| Private IP Address | A private IP address assigned to a private endpoint, used to connect to the Azure SQL Database instance. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link include:
* Private endpoints: creating a private endpoint for an Azure SQL Database instance to connect to a virtual network.
* Private link connections: establishing a secure and private connection between the private endpoint and clients running in the virtual network.
* Network security: using network security groups to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from the virtual network.
* Private IP addressing: assigning a private IP address to the private endpoint to connect to the Azure SQL Database instance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link involves the following components:
* Azure SQL Database instance: the database instance that needs to be secured.
* Private endpoint: a network interface that connects the Azure SQL Database instance to a virtual network.
* Virtual network: a virtualized network environment that allows clients to connect to the private endpoint.
* Network security group: a security feature that filters and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from the virtual network.
* Private link connection: a secure and private connection between the private endpoint and clients running in the virtual network.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link include:
* Creating a private endpoint for an Azure SQL Database instance to connect to a virtual network.
* Using network security groups to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from the virtual network.
* Assigning a private IP address to the private endpoint to connect to the Azure SQL Database instance.
* Establishing a private link connection between the private endpoint and clients running in the virtual network.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Azure SQL Database Security: Private Link include:
* Exposing the Azure SQL Database instance to the public internet without using a private endpoint.
* Not using network security groups to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from the virtual network.
* Not assigning a private IP address to the private endpoint, instead using a public IP address.
* Not establishing a private link connection between the private endpoint and clients running in the virtual network.
