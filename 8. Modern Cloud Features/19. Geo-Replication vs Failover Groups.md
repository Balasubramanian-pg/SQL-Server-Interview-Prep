# 19. Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups

Canonical documentation for 19. Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups is to provide a comprehensive understanding of two distinct approaches to ensuring high availability and disaster recovery in distributed systems. Geo-replication focuses on replicating data across multiple geographic locations to ensure data durability and availability, whereas failover groups prioritize automatic switching to a redundant system or component in the event of a failure. The class of problems addressed by these concepts includes data loss, system downtime, and reduced availability due to natural disasters, hardware failures, or other catastrophic events.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups can be understood as two complementary strategies for achieving high availability and disaster recovery. Geo-replication involves maintaining multiple copies of data in different locations, often using asynchronous or synchronous replication methods. Failover groups, on the other hand, involve configuring systems or components to automatically switch to a redundant or standby instance in the event of a failure. Both approaches require careful planning, implementation, and monitoring to ensure seamless operation and minimal downtime.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Geo-Replication | The process of replicating data across multiple geographic locations to ensure data durability and availability. |
| Failover Group | A configuration of systems or components that automatically switch to a redundant or standby instance in the event of a failure. |
| High Availability | The ability of a system or component to operate continuously without interruption, typically measured as a percentage of uptime. |
| Disaster Recovery | The process of recovering data, systems, or applications after a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster or hardware failure. |
| Asynchronous Replication | A replication method where data is written to a primary location and then replicated to one or more secondary locations at a later time. |
| Synchronous Replication | A replication method where data is written to multiple locations simultaneously, ensuring that all locations have the same data at the same time. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups include data replication, system redundancy, automatic failover, and disaster recovery. Data replication ensures that multiple copies of data are maintained, reducing the risk of data loss. System redundancy provides multiple instances of a system or component, allowing for automatic failover in the event of a failure. Automatic failover enables systems to quickly recover from failures, minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability. Disaster recovery involves planning, implementing, and testing procedures to recover data, systems, or applications after a catastrophic event.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups involves a combination of both approaches. Geo-replication is used to maintain multiple copies of data across different geographic locations, ensuring data durability and availability. Failover groups are configured to automatically switch to a redundant or standby instance in the event of a failure, minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability. This model is often implemented using a combination of asynchronous and synchronous replication methods, depending on the specific requirements of the system or application.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups include:
* Using geo-replication to maintain multiple copies of data across different regions or data centers
* Configuring failover groups to automatically switch to a redundant or standby instance in the event of a failure
* Implementing asynchronous replication for non-critical data and synchronous replication for critical data
* Using load balancers or traffic managers to distribute traffic across multiple instances or locations
* Regularly testing and validating disaster recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and system availability

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in Geo-Replication vs Failover Groups include:
* Relying solely on geo-replication without implementing failover groups, leaving systems vulnerable to single points of failure
* Using only synchronous replication, which can introduce latency and reduce system performance
* Failing to regularly test and validate disaster recovery procedures, leading to data loss or system downtime
* Not considering the impact of network latency and bandwidth on geo-replication and failover groups
* Implementing complex, custom replication or failover solutions that are difficult to maintain and support
