# 40. Cluster Log Analysis (ERRORLOG vs Cluster Log)

Canonical documentation for 40. Cluster Log Analysis (ERRORLOG vs Cluster Log). This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 40. Cluster Log Analysis (ERRORLOG vs Cluster Log) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of cluster log analysis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the events and errors occurring within a cluster environment. This is crucial for identifying, troubleshooting, and resolving issues that may impact the performance, availability, and reliability of the cluster. The problem space addressed by cluster log analysis includes error detection, root cause analysis, and issue resolution, ultimately ensuring the overall health and stability of the cluster.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Cluster log analysis involves the examination of two primary log types: ERRORLOG and Cluster Log. ERRORLOG contains information about errors and exceptions that occur within the cluster, while the Cluster Log provides a detailed record of all cluster-related events, including node additions, removals, and failovers. By analyzing these logs, administrators can gain insights into cluster behavior, identify potential issues, and take corrective actions to prevent or mitigate problems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| ERRORLOG | A log file that contains error messages and exceptions generated by the cluster |
| Cluster Log | A log file that records all cluster-related events, including node changes and failovers |
| Node | A server or machine that is part of the cluster |
| Failover | The process of transferring workload from one node to another in the event of node failure |
| Cluster Event | Any occurrence that affects the cluster, such as node addition or removal |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of cluster log analysis include:
* Log collection and storage: Gathering and storing log data from all nodes in the cluster
* Log analysis: Examining log data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
* Error detection: Identifying errors and exceptions in the ERRORLOG
* Event correlation: Correlating events in the Cluster Log to understand cluster behavior
* Root cause analysis: Determining the underlying cause of issues or problems

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for cluster log analysis involves:
1. Configuring log collection and storage
2. Implementing log analysis and error detection tools
3. Establishing event correlation and root cause analysis procedures
4. Developing a incident response plan
5. Continuously monitoring and reviewing log data to identify areas for improvement

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in cluster log analysis include:
* Regular log rotation and archival
* Automated log analysis and alerting
* Centralized log collection and storage
* Use of log analysis tools and software
* Integration with incident response and problem management processes

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in cluster log analysis include:
* Ignoring or neglecting log analysis
* Failing to configure log collection and storage
* Not implementing automated log analysis and alerting
* Not correlating events across multiple logs
* Not continuously monitoring and reviewing log data
