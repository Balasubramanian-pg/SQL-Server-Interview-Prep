# 39. Failover Testing Procedures

Canonical documentation for 39. Failover Testing Procedures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 39. Failover Testing Procedures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of failover testing procedures is to ensure that systems, applications, or services can automatically switch to a redundant or backup component in the event of a failure, thereby minimizing downtime and maintaining business continuity. The problem space addressed by failover testing procedures includes the risk of system failures, data loss, and service disruptions, which can have significant financial, reputational, and operational impacts on organizations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Failover testing procedures involve a systematic approach to testing the automatic switching of systems, applications, or services from a primary component to a redundant or backup component in the event of a failure. This approach includes identifying potential failure scenarios, designing and implementing failover mechanisms, and testing the failover process to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Failover | The automatic switching of a system, application, or service from a primary component to a redundant or backup component in the event of a failure. |
| Failback | The process of switching back to the primary component after the failure has been resolved. |
| Redundancy | The duplication of critical components or systems to ensure continued operation in the event of a failure. |
| High Availability | The ability of a system, application, or service to operate continuously without interruption, typically achieved through the use of redundant components and failover mechanisms. |
| Disaster Recovery | The process of recovering a system, application, or service after a catastrophic failure or disaster, often involving the use of backup data and systems. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of failover testing procedures include:
* Identifying potential failure scenarios and assessing their likelihood and impact
* Designing and implementing failover mechanisms, such as redundant systems, backup power supplies, and automated switching protocols
* Testing the failover process to ensure its effectiveness and reliability
* Monitoring and maintaining the failover system to ensure its continued operation and effectiveness
* Continuously reviewing and updating the failover testing procedures to ensure they remain relevant and effective

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for failover testing procedures typically involves the following steps:
1. Planning and preparation: Identify potential failure scenarios, assess their likelihood and impact, and design and implement failover mechanisms.
2. Testing: Test the failover process to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.
3. Evaluation: Evaluate the results of the testing and identify areas for improvement.
4. Implementation: Implement the failover mechanism and ensure its continued operation and effectiveness.
5. Maintenance: Continuously monitor and maintain the failover system to ensure its continued operation and effectiveness.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in failover testing procedures include:
* Regularly scheduled testing: Testing the failover process on a regular schedule, such as monthly or quarterly, to ensure its continued effectiveness and reliability.
* Automated testing: Using automated tools and scripts to test the failover process, reducing the risk of human error and increasing the efficiency of the testing process.
* Failover testing in multiple scenarios: Testing the failover process in multiple scenarios, such as power outages, network failures, and hardware failures, to ensure its effectiveness in different situations.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in failover testing procedures include:
* Infrequent testing: Failing to test the failover process on a regular schedule, which can lead to a lack of confidence in its effectiveness and reliability.
* Inadequate testing: Failing to test the failover process in multiple scenarios, which can lead to a lack of preparedness for different types of failures.
* Insufficient documentation: Failing to document the failover testing procedures, which can lead to a lack of knowledge and understanding of the process among team members.
