# 3. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit

Canonical documentation for 3. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 3. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit paradigm exists to address the fundamental trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance in distributed systems. It provides a framework for designers and developers to balance the need for data consistency and durability with the requirements for high availability and responsiveness. The class of problems it addresses includes distributed transaction management, fault tolerance, and system scalability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, the Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit debate revolves around how to handle the commitment of transactions in a distributed system. Synchronous commit requires that all nodes in the system agree on the outcome of a transaction before it is considered complete, whereas asynchronous commit allows nodes to proceed with their local operations without waiting for consensus. This fundamental difference in approach has significant implications for system design, performance, and fault tolerance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Synchronous Commit | A commit protocol that requires all nodes in a distributed system to agree on the outcome of a transaction before it is considered complete. |
| Asynchronous Commit | A commit protocol that allows nodes in a distributed system to proceed with their local operations without waiting for consensus from all nodes. |
| Distributed Transaction | A transaction that spans multiple nodes in a distributed system, requiring coordination to ensure consistency and durability. |
| Consistency Model | A set of rules that define how data is accessed and updated in a distributed system to ensure data integrity and consistency. |
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when one or more nodes fail or become unavailable. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit include:
* **Consistency**: Ensuring that data is handled correctly and consistently across all nodes in the system.
* **Availability**: Ensuring that the system remains operational and accessible even in the presence of failures or partitions.
* **Partition Tolerance**: Ensuring that the system can continue to function even when network partitions occur.
* **Latency**: Minimizing the time it takes for transactions to complete and for nodes to respond to requests.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit is based on the CAP theorem, which states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously guarantee more than two of the following:
* **Consistency**: All nodes in the system see the same data values for a given data item.
* **Availability**: Every request to a non-failing node in the system will result in a response.
* **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to function even when network partitions occur.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit include:
* **Master-Slave Replication**: A pattern where one node (the master) accepts writes and replicates them to one or more slave nodes.
* **Multi-Master Replication**: A pattern where all nodes can accept writes and replicate them to each other.
* **Eventual Consistency**: A pattern where nodes may temporarily have different values for a given data item, but will eventually converge to the same value.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commit include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Implementing a system where nodes are tightly coupled, making it difficult to scale or modify the system.
* **Over-Reliance on Synchronous Commit**: Using synchronous commit for all transactions, even when asynchronous commit would be more suitable.
* **Ignoring Fault Tolerance**: Failing to design a system with fault tolerance in mind, leading to system failures or data loss.
