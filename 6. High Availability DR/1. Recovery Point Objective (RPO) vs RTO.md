# 1. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) vs RTO

Canonical documentation for 1. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) vs RTO. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 1. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) vs RTO exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are two fundamental concepts in disaster recovery and business continuity planning. They exist to address the class of problems related to data loss and system downtime, which can have significant financial, operational, and reputational impacts on organizations. RPO and RTO provide a framework for organizations to define their tolerance for data loss and system downtime, ensuring that they can recover from disruptions and resume operations within a specified timeframe.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of RPO and RTO involves understanding the relationship between data loss, system downtime, and the time it takes to recover from a disaster. RPO focuses on the point in time to which data can be recovered, while RTO focuses on the time it takes to restore systems and resume operations. Together, they form a comprehensive approach to disaster recovery and business continuity planning.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| RPO (Recovery Point Objective) | The maximum amount of data that can be lost in the event of a disaster, measured in terms of time (e.g., hours, days) |
| RTO (Recovery Time Objective) | The maximum amount of time allowed to restore systems and resume operations after a disaster |
| Disaster Recovery | The process of recovering from a disaster or major disruption, including restoring systems, data, and operations |
| Business Continuity | The ability of an organization to continue operating during and after a disaster or major disruption |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of RPO and RTO involve understanding the following fundamental ideas:
* Data loss and system downtime have significant impacts on organizations
* Organizations have different tolerance levels for data loss and system downtime
* RPO and RTO provide a framework for defining and achieving these tolerance levels
* Disaster recovery and business continuity planning are critical to minimizing the impacts of disruptions

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for RPO and RTO involves the following steps:
1. Define the RPO and RTO for each system and application
2. Develop a disaster recovery plan that meets the defined RPO and RTO
3. Implement the disaster recovery plan, including regular backups, testing, and training
4. Continuously monitor and review the disaster recovery plan to ensure it remains effective and aligned with changing business needs

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in RPO and RTO include:
* Regular backups and data replication to minimize data loss
* Automated failover and disaster recovery processes to reduce downtime
* Continuous monitoring and testing of disaster recovery plans to ensure effectiveness
* Training and awareness programs to ensure that personnel understand their roles and responsibilities in disaster recovery

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in RPO and RTO include:
* Failing to define RPO and RTO, leading to unclear expectations and inadequate disaster recovery planning
* Inadequate testing and training, leading to ineffective disaster recovery processes
* Insufficient resources and budget allocation, leading to inadequate disaster recovery capabilities
* Ignoring changing business needs and failing to update disaster recovery plans accordingly
