# 4. Automatic vs Manual Failover

Canonical documentation for 4. Automatic vs Manual Failover. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 4. Automatic vs Manual Failover exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Automatic vs Manual Failover is to provide a reliable and efficient way to switch between primary and secondary systems in the event of a failure, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime. The class of problems it addresses includes system failures, network outages, and other disruptions that can impact service availability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Automatic vs Manual Failover refers to the two primary approaches to failover: automatic, where the system automatically switches to a secondary component or system in the event of a failure, and manual, where human intervention is required to initiate the failover process. This concept is critical in designing and implementing high-availability systems, as it directly impacts the system's ability to recover from failures and maintain service continuity.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Automatic Failover | A process where a system automatically switches to a secondary component or system in the event of a failure, without requiring human intervention. |
| Manual Failover | A process where human intervention is required to initiate the failover process, switching from a primary to a secondary component or system. |
| Failover | The process of switching from a primary component or system to a secondary one in the event of a failure, to maintain service continuity. |
| High Availability | A system design principle that aims to ensure a system or service is always available and accessible, with minimal downtime. |
| Redundancy | The duplication of critical components or systems to ensure that if one fails, the other can take over, maintaining service continuity. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Automatic vs Manual Failover include:
- **Detection of Failure**: The ability to detect when a primary component or system has failed.
- **Failover Triggering**: The mechanism that initiates the failover process, which can be automatic or manual.
- **Redundancy**: Having duplicate components or systems that can take over in the event of a failure.
- **System Design**: The architecture and design of the system, including how components interact and how failover is implemented.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Automatic vs Manual Failover involves:
1. **Primary and Secondary Components**: Identifying primary and secondary components or systems.
2. **Failure Detection**: Implementing a mechanism for detecting failures in the primary component.
3. **Failover Mechanism**: Establishing an automatic or manual failover mechanism to switch to the secondary component upon failure detection.
4. **Redundancy and Backup**: Ensuring redundancy and backup systems are in place to support failover.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Automatic vs Manual Failover include:
- **Active-Passive Configuration**: Where one component is active and the other is passive, waiting to take over in case of a failure.
- **Active-Active Configuration**: Where both components are active and serving requests, with the ability to take over the full load if one fails.
- **Automated Health Checks**: Regularly checking the health of primary and secondary components to detect potential failures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Automatic vs Manual Failover include:
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Designing a system where a single component's failure can bring down the entire system.
- **Insufficient Testing**: Failing to adequately test failover mechanisms, leading to unexpected behaviors during actual failures.
- **Manual Intervention as Primary Strategy**: Relying solely on manual intervention for failover, which can lead to delays and increased downtime.
