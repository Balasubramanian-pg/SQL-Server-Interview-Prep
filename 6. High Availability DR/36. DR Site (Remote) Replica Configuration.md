# 36. DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration

Canonical documentation for 36. DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 36. DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration exists to provide a disaster recovery solution for organizations, ensuring business continuity in the event of a disaster or major outage. The class of problems it addresses includes data loss, system downtime, and the inability to access critical applications and services. By configuring a remote replica of the primary site, organizations can minimize the risk of data loss and ensure that their systems and applications remain available, even in the event of a disaster.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration involves creating a duplicate of the primary site at a remote location, which is synchronized in real-time or near real-time with the primary site. This duplicate site, also known as a disaster recovery site, is designed to take over operations in the event of a disaster or major outage, ensuring minimal disruption to business operations. The configuration involves setting up a remote replica of the primary site's infrastructure, including servers, storage, and network components, as well as configuring data replication and synchronization mechanisms to ensure that data is up-to-date and consistent across both sites.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Disaster Recovery (DR) | The process of recovering IT systems, applications, and data in the event of a disaster or major outage. |
| Remote Replica | A duplicate of the primary site, located at a remote location, which is synchronized with the primary site. |
| Primary Site | The main site where IT systems, applications, and data are located. |
| Replication | The process of copying data from the primary site to the remote replica site. |
| Synchronization | The process of ensuring that data is consistent and up-to-date across both the primary site and the remote replica site. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration include:
* Data replication: The process of copying data from the primary site to the remote replica site.
* Data synchronization: The process of ensuring that data is consistent and up-to-date across both the primary site and the remote replica site.
* Site failover: The process of switching operations from the primary site to the remote replica site in the event of a disaster or major outage.
* Site failback: The process of switching operations back to the primary site once the disaster or outage has been resolved.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration involves a three-step process:
1. Assessment: Assessing the organization's IT infrastructure, applications, and data to determine the requirements for the disaster recovery site.
2. Design: Designing the disaster recovery site, including the infrastructure, applications, and data replication and synchronization mechanisms.
3. Implementation: Implementing the disaster recovery site, including setting up the remote replica, configuring data replication and synchronization, and testing the site to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration include:
* Active-passive configuration: Where the primary site is active and the remote replica site is passive, taking over operations only in the event of a disaster or major outage.
* Active-active configuration: Where both the primary site and the remote replica site are active, with traffic being routed to both sites.
* Pilot light configuration: Where a minimal version of the primary site is maintained at the remote replica site, with the ability to quickly scale up to full production in the event of a disaster or major outage.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for DR Site (Remote) Replica Configuration include:
* Not testing the disaster recovery site regularly, which can lead to errors and failures when the site is needed.
* Not keeping the remote replica site up-to-date with the latest software and security patches, which can lead to vulnerabilities and security risks.
* Not having a clear plan for site failover and failback, which can lead to confusion and delays in the event of a disaster or major outage.
