# 34. Maintenance Plans in HA Environments

Canonical documentation for 34. Maintenance Plans in HA Environments. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 34. Maintenance Plans in HA Environments exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of maintenance plans in High Availability (HA) environments is to ensure the continuous operation and optimal performance of critical systems, despite hardware or software failures, by providing a proactive and structured approach to maintenance. The class of problems it addresses includes minimizing downtime, reducing the risk of data loss, and maintaining system reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Maintenance plans in HA environments involve a comprehensive and systematic approach to maintaining the health, performance, and availability of critical systems. This includes monitoring system components, performing routine maintenance tasks, and having a plan in place for responding to failures or other disruptions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| High Availability (HA) | A system design approach that ensures a high level of operational continuity, typically by duplicating critical components and using failover mechanisms. |
| Maintenance Plan | A documented set of procedures and schedules for performing routine maintenance tasks on a system. |
| Failover | The automatic switching of a system or component to a redundant or backup component in the event of a failure. |
| Redundancy | The duplication of critical system components to ensure continued operation in the event of a failure. |
| Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) | A measure of the time it takes to recover a system or component from a failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of maintenance plans in HA environments include:
* Redundancy: duplicating critical system components to ensure continued operation in the event of a failure.
* Failover: automatically switching to a redundant or backup component in the event of a failure.
* Monitoring: continuously monitoring system components to detect potential issues before they become incidents.
* Maintenance scheduling: scheduling routine maintenance tasks to minimize downtime and ensure optimal system performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for maintenance plans in HA environments typically includes:
1. System monitoring and alerting
2. Routine maintenance tasks (e.g., backups, software updates)
3. Failover and redundancy configurations
4. Incident response and recovery procedures
5. Continuous review and improvement of the maintenance plan

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in maintenance plans for HA environments include:
* Regularly scheduled maintenance windows
* Automated monitoring and alerting systems
* Standardized incident response procedures
* Continuous training and education for system administrators

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in maintenance plans for HA environments include:
* Neglecting routine maintenance tasks
* Failing to test failover and redundancy configurations
* Not having a plan in place for responding to incidents
* Not continuously reviewing and improving the maintenance plan
