# 13. Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber

Canonical documentation for 13. Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 13. Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber exists to provide a reliable and efficient method for replicating data across multiple databases, ensuring data consistency and minimizing latency. The class of problems it addresses includes data synchronization, high availability, and disaster recovery in distributed database systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber involves a publisher, which is the primary database that accepts changes, a distributor, which acts as an intermediary for the publisher, and a subscriber, which is the secondary database that receives the replicated data. The publisher and subscriber can be the same database, and the distributor can be a separate database or the same as the publisher.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Publisher | The primary database that accepts changes and is responsible for sending transactions to the distributor. |
| Distributor | The intermediary database that receives transactions from the publisher and forwards them to the subscriber. |
| Subscriber | The secondary database that receives the replicated data from the distributor. |
| Transaction | A sequence of operations performed on the publisher database that is replicated to the subscriber database. |
| Replication | The process of copying and maintaining database objects in multiple databases. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber include:
* **Publishing**: The process of identifying the data to be replicated and preparing it for distribution.
* **Distributing**: The process of transferring the replicated data from the publisher to the subscriber.
* **Subscribing**: The process of receiving and applying the replicated data to the subscriber database.
* **Latency**: The delay between the time data is modified at the publisher and the time it is available at the subscriber.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber involves a single publisher, a single distributor, and one or more subscribers. The publisher and distributor can be the same database, and the subscribers can be configured to receive a subset of the published data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber include:
* **Centralized publishing**: A single publisher distributes data to multiple subscribers.
* **Decentralized publishing**: Multiple publishers distribute data to a single subscriber.
* **Hierarchical publishing**: A publisher distributes data to multiple subscribers, which in turn distribute data to other subscribers.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Transaction Replication: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber include:
* **Over-replication**: Replicating data that is not necessary or is already available at the subscriber.
* **Under-replication**: Failing to replicate critical data, resulting in data inconsistencies.
* **Incorrect subscriber configuration**: Configuring subscribers to receive incorrect or incomplete data.
