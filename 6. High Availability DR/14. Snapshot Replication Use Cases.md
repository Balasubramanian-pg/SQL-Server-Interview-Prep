# 14. Snapshot Replication Use Cases

Canonical documentation for 14. Snapshot Replication Use Cases. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 14. Snapshot Replication Use Cases exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of snapshot replication is to create a copy of a dataset at a specific point in time, allowing for efficient data recovery, testing, and analysis. The problem space addressed by snapshot replication includes data loss, corruption, and inconsistency, as well as the need for efficient data management and retrieval. Snapshot replication use cases exist to provide a solution for these problems by enabling the creation of multiple, independent copies of a dataset.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Snapshot replication involves creating a copy of a dataset at a specific point in time, which can then be used to recover data in case of loss or corruption, or to test and analyze the data without affecting the primary dataset. This process typically involves a source dataset, a target dataset, and a replication mechanism that manages the transfer of data between the two.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Snapshot | A copy of a dataset at a specific point in time |
| Replication | The process of creating and maintaining multiple copies of a dataset |
| Source Dataset | The original dataset from which the snapshot is created |
| Target Dataset | The dataset that receives the replicated data |
| Replication Mechanism | The system or process that manages the transfer of data between the source and target datasets |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of snapshot replication include:
* **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that the replicated data is consistent with the source data at the time of replication
* **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that the replicated data is not corrupted or altered during the replication process
* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum amount of data that can be lost in the event of a failure
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum amount of time it takes to recover data in the event of a failure

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for snapshot replication involves the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: The source and target datasets are initialized, and the replication mechanism is configured.
2. **Snapshot Creation**: A snapshot of the source dataset is created at a specific point in time.
3. **Replication**: The snapshot is replicated to the target dataset.
4. **Verification**: The replicated data is verified to ensure consistency and integrity.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in snapshot replication include:
* **Periodic Snapshots**: Creating snapshots at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly)
* **Event-Driven Snapshots**: Creating snapshots in response to specific events (e.g., data updates, system failures)
* **Incremental Replication**: Replicating only the changes made to the source dataset since the last snapshot

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in snapshot replication include:
* **Over-Replication**: Creating too many snapshots, leading to storage and management issues
* **Under-Replication**: Creating too few snapshots, leading to data loss and recovery issues
* **Inconsistent Replication**: Failing to replicate data consistently, leading to data inconsistencies and integrity issues
