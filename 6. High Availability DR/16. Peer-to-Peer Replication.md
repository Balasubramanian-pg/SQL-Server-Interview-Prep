# 16. Peer-to-Peer Replication

Canonical documentation for 16. Peer-to-Peer Replication. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 16. Peer-to-Peer Replication exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Peer-to-Peer Replication exists to provide a decentralized, fault-tolerant, and scalable data replication mechanism. It addresses the class of problems related to data consistency, availability, and durability in distributed systems, where multiple nodes need to maintain a consistent view of the data. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a single point of failure is unacceptable, and data needs to be highly available and resilient to node failures.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Peer-to-Peer Replication is a distributed data replication approach where each node in the system acts as both a client and a server, replicating data with its peers. Each node maintains a copy of the data and communicates with other nodes to ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of the data. This approach allows for high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance, as the system can continue to function even if one or more nodes fail.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Node | A participant in the Peer-to-Peer Replication system, responsible for maintaining a copy of the data and communicating with other nodes. |
| Peer | A node that participates in the replication process with other nodes. |
| Replication Factor | The number of nodes that maintain a copy of the data. |
| Consistency Model | The rules that govern how data is updated and propagated across nodes in the system. |
| Conflict Resolution | The process of resolving inconsistencies or conflicts that arise when multiple nodes update the same data simultaneously. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Peer-to-Peer Replication include:
* **Decentralization**: Each node acts as both a client and a server, and there is no central authority controlling the replication process.
* **Data Partitioning**: Data is divided into smaller chunks, and each node maintains a copy of one or more chunks.
* **Replication**: Each node replicates its data with one or more peers to ensure that multiple nodes have a copy of the data.
* **Consistency**: Nodes communicate with each other to ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of the data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Peer-to-Peer Replication involves the following components:
* **Node Discovery**: A mechanism for nodes to discover each other and establish connections.
* **Data Replication**: A mechanism for nodes to replicate data with each other.
* **Conflict Resolution**: A mechanism for resolving conflicts that arise when multiple nodes update the same data simultaneously.
* **Node Failure Handling**: A mechanism for handling node failures and ensuring that the system remains available and consistent.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Peer-to-Peer Replication include:
* **Master-Master Replication**: Each node accepts updates and replicates data with its peers.
* **Master-Slave Replication**: One node accepts updates and replicates data with its peers, while the peers only replicate data and do not accept updates.
* **Multi-Master Replication**: Multiple nodes accept updates and replicate data with each other.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Peer-to-Peer Replication include:
* **Single Point of Failure**: Relying on a single node or central authority to control the replication process.
* **Inconsistent Data**: Failing to implement a consistent data model or conflict resolution mechanism, leading to inconsistent data across nodes.
* **Poor Node Discovery**: Failing to implement an effective node discovery mechanism, leading to nodes being unable to connect with each other.
