# 23. Cross-Cluster Availability Groups

Canonical documentation for 23. Cross-Cluster Availability Groups. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 23. Cross-Cluster Availability Groups exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Cross-Cluster Availability Groups exist to provide high availability and disaster recovery capabilities for distributed databases and applications. The primary problem space addressed by Cross-Cluster Availability Groups is the need for continuous access to data and applications across multiple clusters, ensuring business continuity and minimizing downtime in the event of failures or disasters.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Cross-Cluster Availability Groups involve the replication and synchronization of data across multiple clusters, typically located in different geographic regions or data centers. This allows for automatic failover and failback of applications and services, ensuring high availability and minimizing data loss.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Availability Group | A group of databases or applications that are replicated and synchronized across multiple clusters to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. |
| Cluster | A group of servers or nodes that work together to provide a highly available and scalable environment for applications and services. |
| Cross-Cluster Replication | The process of replicating data across multiple clusters, typically located in different geographic regions or data centers. |
| Failover | The automatic switching of applications or services to a standby cluster or node in the event of a failure or disaster. |
| Failback | The automatic switching of applications or services back to the primary cluster or node after a failure or disaster has been resolved. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Cross-Cluster Availability Groups include:
* Data replication and synchronization across multiple clusters
* Automatic failover and failback of applications and services
* High availability and disaster recovery capabilities
* Scalability and flexibility to support growing applications and services

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Cross-Cluster Availability Groups typically involves:
* Multiple clusters located in different geographic regions or data centers
* Data replication and synchronization across clusters using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous replication methods
* Automatic failover and failback of applications and services using a combination of cluster-level and application-level failover mechanisms
* Monitoring and management of Cross-Cluster Availability Groups using a centralized management platform

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Cross-Cluster Availability Groups include:
* Active-passive clustering, where one cluster is active and the other is passive
* Active-active clustering, where both clusters are active and handle read-write traffic
* Multi-master replication, where data is replicated across multiple clusters and each cluster can accept writes

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Cross-Cluster Availability Groups include:
* Using a single cluster for all applications and services, without providing redundancy or failover capabilities
* Not monitoring or managing Cross-Cluster Availability Groups, leading to downtime and data loss
* Not testing failover and failback procedures, leading to unexpected behavior during disasters or failures
