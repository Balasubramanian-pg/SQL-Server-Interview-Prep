# 20. Secondary Replica Backups

Canonical documentation for 20. Secondary Replica Backups. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. Secondary Replica Backups exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Secondary Replica Backups is to provide a redundant copy of data in a separate location, ensuring business continuity and minimizing data loss in the event of a primary system failure. This addresses the problem of data availability and recoverability, which is critical for organizations that rely on data-driven operations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Secondary Replica Backups involve creating a secondary copy of data, which is synchronized with the primary data source. This secondary copy is typically stored in a separate location, such as a different data center or cloud region, to ensure that data is available even if the primary location is unavailable.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Primary Data Source | The original source of data, which is used to create the secondary replica |
| Secondary Replica | A copy of the primary data source, which is synchronized with the primary data source |
| Backup | A copy of data, which is stored in a separate location for recovery purposes |
| Replication | The process of creating and maintaining a secondary replica of data |
| RPO (Recovery Point Objective) | The maximum amount of data that can be lost in the event of a failure |
| RTO (Recovery Time Objective) | The maximum amount of time that it takes to recover data in the event of a failure |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Secondary Replica Backups include data replication, backup and recovery, and disaster recovery. Data replication involves creating a secondary copy of data, which is synchronized with the primary data source. Backup and recovery involve creating a copy of data, which is stored in a separate location for recovery purposes. Disaster recovery involves restoring data and systems in the event of a failure.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Secondary Replica Backups involves creating a secondary replica of data, which is stored in a separate location. This secondary replica is synchronized with the primary data source, and is used to recover data in the event of a failure. The standard model also involves regular backups of data, which are stored in a separate location for recovery purposes.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Secondary Replica Backups include:
* Creating a secondary replica of data in a separate location, such as a different data center or cloud region
* Synchronizing the secondary replica with the primary data source in real-time or near real-time
* Using a backup and recovery solution to create regular backups of data
* Testing and validating backups and replicas to ensure data recoverability

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Secondary Replica Backups include:
* Not creating a secondary replica of data, which can result in data loss in the event of a failure
* Not synchronizing the secondary replica with the primary data source, which can result in data inconsistencies
* Not testing and validating backups and replicas, which can result in data recoverability issues
* Not storing backups and replicas in a separate location, which can result in data loss in the event of a failure
