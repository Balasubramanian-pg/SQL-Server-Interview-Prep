# 6. Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters

Canonical documentation for 6. Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 6. Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters exist to provide high availability and scalability for critical applications and services in distributed environments. The primary problem space addressed by Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters is the need for continuous availability and minimal downtime in the event of node or network failures. This is particularly important in scenarios where applications are deployed across multiple subnets, and traditional failover clustering methods may not be effective.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A Multi-Subnet Failover Cluster is a configuration of multiple nodes, each residing in a different subnet, that work together to provide high availability and scalability for applications and services. This configuration allows for the automatic failover of resources in the event of a node or network failure, ensuring minimal downtime and continuous availability. The cluster is typically managed by a clustering software that monitors the health of each node and orchestrates the failover process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Node | A server or computer that is part of a cluster |
| Subnet | A sub-network that is part of a larger network |
| Failover | The process of automatically switching to a standby node or resource in the event of a failure |
| Cluster | A group of nodes that work together to provide high availability and scalability |
| Quorum | A minimum number of nodes required for a cluster to function and make decisions |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters include:
* **Node management**: The process of monitoring and managing the health and status of each node in the cluster.
* **Failover orchestration**: The process of automatically switching to a standby node or resource in the event of a failure.
* **Quorum management**: The process of ensuring that a minimum number of nodes are available to maintain the integrity of the cluster.
* **Network communication**: The process of enabling communication between nodes in different subnets.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters typically consists of:
* **Multiple nodes**: Each node resides in a different subnet and is configured to provide a specific service or application.
* **Clustering software**: A software solution that manages the cluster, monitors node health, and orchestrates failover.
* **Network infrastructure**: A network infrastructure that enables communication between nodes in different subnets.
* **Quorum configuration**: A configuration that ensures a minimum number of nodes are available to maintain the integrity of the cluster.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters include:
* **Active-passive configuration**: One node is active, while the other nodes are passive and serve as standby nodes.
* **Active-active configuration**: All nodes are active and serve as equal participants in the cluster.
* **Geographically dispersed clusters**: Nodes are dispersed across multiple geographic locations to provide disaster recovery and business continuity.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Multi-Subnet Failover Clusters include:
* **Single point of failure**: A single node or component that, if failed, can bring down the entire cluster.
* **Inadequate quorum configuration**: A quorum configuration that is inadequate to maintain the integrity of the cluster.
* **Insufficient network infrastructure**: A network infrastructure that is insufficient to support communication between nodes in different subnets.
