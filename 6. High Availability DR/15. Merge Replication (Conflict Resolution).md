# 15. Merge Replication (Conflict Resolution)

Canonical documentation for 15. Merge Replication (Conflict Resolution). This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 15. Merge Replication (Conflict Resolution) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Merge replication is a type of replication that allows multiple servers to accept updates and then reconciles these updates to maintain data consistency across all servers. Conflict resolution is a critical component of merge replication, as it enables the system to handle discrepancies that arise when multiple servers attempt to update the same data simultaneously. The primary problem that merge replication with conflict resolution addresses is ensuring data integrity and consistency in a distributed database environment, where multiple users or systems may be updating the same data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of merge replication with conflict resolution involves a distributed database system where data is replicated across multiple servers. Each server can accept updates from users or applications, and these updates are periodically synchronized with other servers in the system. When conflicts arise due to simultaneous updates, the conflict resolution mechanism is triggered to resolve the discrepancies and ensure that the data remains consistent across all servers.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Merge Replication | A type of replication that allows multiple servers to accept updates and then reconciles these updates to maintain data consistency. |
| Conflict Resolution | The process of resolving discrepancies that arise when multiple servers attempt to update the same data simultaneously. |
| Publisher | The server that initiates the replication process and is responsible for sending updates to other servers. |
| Subscriber | A server that receives updates from the publisher and applies them to its local database. |
| Article | A database object, such as a table or view, that is being replicated. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of merge replication with conflict resolution include:
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that data is consistent across all servers in the system.
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifying discrepancies that arise when multiple servers attempt to update the same data simultaneously.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolving the discrepancies using a predefined set of rules or algorithms.
- **Synchronization**: Periodically updating each server with the latest changes from other servers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for merge replication with conflict resolution involves the following components:
- **Publisher**: The central server that initiates the replication process.
- **Subscribers**: Multiple servers that receive updates from the publisher.
- **Distributor**: A server that acts as an intermediary between the publisher and subscribers, managing the flow of updates.
- **Conflict Resolution Algorithm**: A predefined set of rules or algorithms that resolve conflicts when they arise.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in merge replication with conflict resolution include:
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: A topology where a central publisher distributes updates to multiple subscribers.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: A topology where each server acts as both a publisher and a subscriber, updating each other directly.
- **Hierarchical**: A topology where updates flow from a central publisher to multiple levels of subscribers.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in merge replication with conflict resolution include:
- **Not Implementing Conflict Resolution**: Failing to define a conflict resolution algorithm, leading to data inconsistencies.
- **Inadequate Synchronization**: Failing to synchronize servers regularly, leading to outdated data.
- **Insufficient Monitoring**: Failing to monitor the replication process, leading to undetected conflicts or errors.
