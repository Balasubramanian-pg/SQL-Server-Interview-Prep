Canonical documentation for 38. Managed Backup to Azure. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 38. Managed Backup to Azure exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Managed Backup to Azure is to provide a reliable, secure, and scalable backup solution for organizations to protect their data in the cloud. The problem space it addresses includes data loss, corruption, and unavailability due to various factors such as hardware failures, software errors, and cyber-attacks. Managed Backup to Azure aims to mitigate these risks by providing a managed backup service that automates data backup, storage, and recovery processes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Managed Backup to Azure is a cloud-based backup solution that leverages Azure services to provide a secure, scalable, and reliable backup infrastructure. The solution involves integrating on-premises or cloud-based data sources with Azure Backup services, which provides a centralized management console for configuring, monitoring, and recovering backups. The conceptual overview involves understanding the key components, including data sources, backup agents, Azure Backup services, and storage repositories.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Backup | The process of creating a copy of data to prevent data loss or corruption. |
| Recovery | The process of restoring data from a backup to its original state. |
| Azure Backup | A cloud-based backup service provided by Microsoft Azure. |
| Data Source | The origin of the data to be backed up, such as on-premises servers, cloud-based applications, or databases. |
| Backup Agent | A software component that integrates with the data source to facilitate backup operations. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Managed Backup to Azure include:
* Data protection: ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data.
* Backup and recovery: creating and managing backups, as well as restoring data from backups.
* Cloud-based infrastructure: leveraging Azure services to provide a scalable, secure, and reliable backup infrastructure.
* Automation: using software agents and scripts to automate backup and recovery processes.
* Monitoring and reporting: providing real-time visibility into backup operations and recovery processes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Managed Backup to Azure involves the following components and processes:
1. Data source identification and assessment.
2. Backup agent deployment and configuration.
3. Azure Backup service configuration and setup.
4. Backup schedule and policy definition.
5. Monitoring and reporting of backup operations.
6. Recovery process definition and testing.

## 6. Common Patterns

Common patterns in Managed Backup to Azure include:
* Daily incremental backups with weekly full backups.
* Monthly or quarterly long-term retention backups.
* Automated backup and recovery process using scripts and software agents.
* Centralized management and monitoring of backup operations.
* Regular testing and validation of recovery processes.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Managed Backup to Azure include:
* Manual backup and recovery processes.
* Inconsistent or incomplete backup schedules.
* Insufficient storage capacity or retention periods.
* Lack of monitoring and reporting of backup operations.
* Inadequate testing and validation of recovery processes.
