# 25. Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups

Canonical documentation for 25. Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 25. Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups exist to provide high availability and disaster recovery capabilities for databases in environments where a traditional Windows domain infrastructure is not available or not desired. This addresses the class of problems related to database availability and redundancy in workgroup or domainless environments, such as small to medium-sized businesses, remote offices, or cloud-based deployments.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups are a type of database availability group that allows multiple instances of SQL Server to work together to provide high availability and disaster recovery capabilities without the need for a traditional Windows domain infrastructure. This is achieved through the use of a workgroup or domainless configuration, where each instance of SQL Server is configured to communicate with each other directly, without the need for a domain controller.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Availability Group | A group of databases that are replicated across multiple instances of SQL Server to provide high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. |
| Workgroup | A type of network configuration where multiple computers are connected together without the need for a domain controller. |
| Domainless | A type of configuration where a computer or instance of SQL Server is not joined to a traditional Windows domain infrastructure. |
| Listener | A virtual network name that clients use to connect to an availability group. |
| Replica | A copy of a database that is maintained by an instance of SQL Server in an availability group. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups include:
* Database replication: The process of maintaining multiple copies of a database across multiple instances of SQL Server.
* Automatic failover: The ability of an availability group to automatically failover to a secondary replica in the event of a failure.
* Manual failover: The ability of an administrator to manually failover an availability group to a secondary replica.
* Seeding: The process of initializing a new replica with a copy of the database.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups includes:
* A minimum of two instances of SQL Server, each configured as a replica in the availability group.
* A listener configured to provide a virtual network name for clients to connect to the availability group.
* A witness server configured to provide quorum voting capabilities for the availability group.
* Automatic failover enabled to provide high availability capabilities.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups include:
* Using a cloud-based witness server to provide quorum voting capabilities.
* Configuring multiple listeners to provide load balancing and high availability capabilities.
* Using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous replication to provide a balance between high availability and performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Workgroup (Domainless) Availability Groups include:
* Configuring a single instance of SQL Server as the only replica in the availability group, which provides no high availability capabilities.
* Disabling automatic failover, which requires manual intervention in the event of a failure.
* Using a single listener, which provides no load balancing capabilities.
