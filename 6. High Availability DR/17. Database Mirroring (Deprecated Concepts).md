# 17. Database Mirroring (Deprecated Concepts)

Canonical documentation for 17. Database Mirroring (Deprecated Concepts). This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 17. Database Mirroring (Deprecated Concepts) exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Database mirroring was a technique used to maintain two or more copies of a database in sync, providing high availability, disaster recovery, and improved performance. However, due to the evolution of database technologies and the introduction of more advanced replication methods, database mirroring has become a deprecated concept. This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of database mirroring, its historical context, and the reasons behind its deprecation.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Database mirroring involves creating a duplicate copy of a database, either on the same server or on a separate server, to ensure data availability and integrity. The primary database, also known as the principal, accepts all write operations, while the mirrored database, or mirror, receives a copy of all changes made to the principal. This setup allows for automatic failover in case the primary database becomes unavailable.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Principal | The primary database that accepts all write operations. |
| Mirror | The duplicate copy of the database that receives all changes made to the principal. |
| Witness | A separate server that monitors the principal and mirror databases and initiates failover in case of a failure. |
| Automatic Failover | The process of automatically switching to the mirror database in case the principal database becomes unavailable. |
| Manual Failover | The process of manually switching to the mirror database, typically performed during maintenance or when the automatic failover mechanism is disabled. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of database mirroring include:
* **Synchronous replication**: The process of replicating data to the mirror database in real-time, ensuring that both databases are always in sync.
* **Asynchronous replication**: The process of replicating data to the mirror database with a delay, which can improve performance but may lead to data inconsistencies.
* **Failover**: The process of switching to the mirror database in case the principal database becomes unavailable.
* **Failback**: The process of switching back to the principal database after a failover.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for database mirroring involves a principal database, a mirror database, and a witness server. The principal and mirror databases are typically configured in a high-availability mode, with the witness server monitoring the databases and initiating failover in case of a failure.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in database mirroring include:
* **High-availability mode**: Configuring the principal and mirror databases to ensure automatic failover in case of a failure.
* **Disaster recovery mode**: Configuring the principal and mirror databases to ensure data availability and integrity in case of a disaster.
* **Performance optimization mode**: Configuring the principal and mirror databases to improve performance by offloading read operations to the mirror database.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in database mirroring include:
* **Insufficient monitoring**: Failing to monitor the principal and mirror databases, which can lead to delayed detection of failures and data inconsistencies.
* **Inadequate testing**: Failing to test the failover and failback processes, which can lead to unexpected behavior and data loss.
* **Incorrect configuration**: Configuring the principal and mirror databases incorrectly, which can lead to data inconsistencies and performance issues.
